## Urinary Chloride

Urinary excretion of chloride mirrors sodium excretion in response to dietary intake. In a manner similar to sodium, the urinary concentration of chloride and fractional excretion of chloride (FECL) can be used as indirect markers of effective circulatory volume. 
我們可以想像，Cl就像是na的一面鏡子，通常尿排出多少鈉，就會排出多少氯。

Despite these similarities, there are situations when the directional change in urinary concentration may differ, such that reliance solely on one or the other can lead to an erroneous assessment of effective volume status. These differences are particularly evident when volume disturbances are accompanied by acid-base disorders ([26](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#ref-26)). For this reason, both urine sodium and chloride should be obtained when using urine electrolytes to assess volume or acid-base status.

A high urine sodium and low chloride concentration in the setting of volume depletion suggests the presence of a nonreabsorbable anion. The nature of the anion can be distinguished using the urine pH and 臨床context. A urine pH of 7 or 8 indicates significant bicarbonaturia, as with active vomiting or nasogastric suction ([27](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#ref-27)–[29](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#ref-29)). The extrarenal generation of metabolic alkalosis leads to excretion of bicarbonate into the urine, which obligates a component of filtered sodium to accompany the base whereas urine chloride remains low in response to neurohumoral activation resulting from volume contraction. A urine sodium-to-chloride ratio of >1.6 is typical in such patients ([26](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#ref-26)). A urine pH <6 suggests another nonreabsorbable anion is responsible, such as ketoanions, or drugs such as ticarcillin disodium clavulanate, piperacillin tazobactam, or carbenicillin disodium. When given in the setting of low effective volume, these antibiotics couple increased delivery of sodium to increased aldosterone levels in the distal nephron, leading to generation of metabolic alkalosis of a kidney origin, accounting for the low urine pH ([Figure 2](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#F2)). In metabolic alkalosis, the urine chloride concentration can be used as a marker as to whether the alkalosis is responsive or resistant to administration of a chloride-containing solution ([30](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#ref-30),[31](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/14/2/306#ref-31)). A low urine chloride indicates a chloride responsive metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting, chloride wasting diarrhea, remote use of diuretics, and posthypercapneic metabolic alkalosis. By contrast, a high urine chloride concentration indicates a chloride resistant alkalosis, as seen in genetic disorders such as Bartter and Gitelman syndrome and hypertensive disorders caused by increased mineralocorticoids or mineralocorticoid-like effect.

### Urine chemistry profile in metabolic alkalosis. (A) Loop and thiazide diuretics and their genetic equivalent (Bartter and Gitelman syndrome, respectively) cause contraction of effective circulatory volume and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Increased distal delivery of sodium coupled with increased mineralocorticoid levels causes increased potassium secretion and an increased rate of hydrogen ion secretion in the distal nephron, leading to the development of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis (27). The fractional excretion (FE) of urea is reduced to <35% because proximal reabsorption of urea is stimulated and unaffected by the downstream impairment in sodium chloride transport. Metabolic alkalosis due to remote use of diuretics is sensitive to chloride-containing solutions but resistant in genetic disorders. (B) Antibiotics such as carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin given in the setting of decreased effective volume act as nonreabsorbable anions, causing increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron, resulting in development of hypokalemia and a chloride-responsive from of metabolic alkalosis. The urine pH (UpH) in this setting is acidic because of augmented hydrogen ion secretion. (C) Active vomiting or nasogastric suction generates a chloride-sensitive form of metabolic alkalosis. Bicarbonate acts as a nonreabsorbable anion, causing increased distal sodium delivery and development of potassium wasting (29). (D) A primary increase in mineralocorticoid levels (Conn syndrome) or effect (Liddle syndrome) leads to a chloride resistant form of metabolic alkalosis accompanied by kidney potassium wasting and hypertension. Increased distal delivery of sodium is due to inhibition of proximal reabsorption brought about by effective volume expansion.
