### Initial workup (_NEJM_ 2014;371:1434)

•✔ **anion gap** (AG) = Na+ – (Cl– + HCO3–) = unmeasured anions – unmeasured cations

if ↑ glc, use measured _not_ corrected Na

expected AG is [albumin] × 2.5 (ie, 10 if albumin is 4 g/dL, 7.5 if albumin is 3 g/dL)

↑ AG → ↑ unmeasured anions such as organic acids, phosphates, sulfates

↓ AG → ↓ alb or ↑ unmeasured cations (Ca, Mg, K, Li, Ig), bromide/iodine toxicity

•If ↑ AG, ✔ **delta-delta** (Δ/Δ = ΔAG/ΔHCO3) to assess if there is an additional metabolic

acid-base disturbance; ΔAG = (calculated AG – expected AG), ΔHCO3 = (24 – HCO3)

Δ/Δ = 1–2 → pure AG metabolic acidosis

Δ/Δ < 1 → AG metabolic acidosis _and_ simultaneous non-AG acidosis

Δ/Δ > 2 → AG metabolic acidosis _and_ simultaneous metabolic alkalosis

For pure lactic acidosis Δ/Δ 1.6 b/c of slow lacatate clearance

### Workup for AG metabolic acidosis

•✔ for **ketonuria** (dipstick acetoacetate) or plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB)

nb, urine acetoacetate often not present in early ketoacidosis due to shunting to βOHB; ∴ acetoacetate may later turn ⊕ but does not signify worsening disease

•If ⊖ ketones, ✔ **renal function**, **lactate**, **toxin screen**, and **osmolal gap**

•If obtunded or ↑↑ AG, check **osmolal gap** (OG) = measured osmoles – calculated osmoles

calculated osmoles = (2 × Na) + (glucose/18) + (BUN/2.8) (+ [EtOH/4.6] if have EtOH level and want to test if other ingestions)

OG >10 → suggests ingestion (see below) but lacks specificity (can be elevated in lactic acidosis, DKA, and alcoholic ketoacidosis)

high-dose lorazepam (>10 mg/h) a/w propylene glycol intoxication

OG & AG vary based on timing, initially OG ↑, then ↓ with metabolism as AG ↑

### Workup for non-AG metabolic acidosis

•Evaluate history for causes (see above)

•✔ **urine anion gap** (UAG) = (UNa + UK) – UCl

UAG = unmeasured anions – unmeasured cations; NH4+ is primary unmeasured cation (represented by UCl). UAG is indirect assay for renal H+ excretion.

•⊖ UAG → ↑ renal NH4+ excretion → appropriate renal response to acidemia

Ddx: GI causes (diarrhea, fistulas, ureteral diversion), IV NS, proximal RTA, ingestions

•⊕ UAG → failure of kidneys to generate NH4+

Ddx: distal (type 1, usually ↓ K) or hypoaldo (type IV, usually ↑ K) RTA, early renal failure

•UAG unreliable in polyuria, Na depletion (UNa <20), UpH >6.5 & HAGMA (causes ⊕ UAG b/c excretion of organic anions). Then use UOsm gap = measured UOsm – [2×(Na+ + K+) + BUN + glc (mmol/L)]. UOsm gap <40 mmol/L indicates impaired NH4+ excretion.

### Renal tubular acidoses (RTAs) (_Int J Clin Pract_ 2011;65:350)

•**Proximal** (Type II): ↓ proximal reabsorption of HCO3

1° (Fanconi’s syndrome) = ↓ proximal reabsorption of HCO3, PO4, glc, amino acids

Acquired: paraprotein (MM, amyloidosis), metals (Pb, Cd, Hg, Cu), ↓ vit D, PNH, renal Tx

Meds: acetazolamide, aminoglycosides, ifosfamide, cisplatin, topiramate, tenofovir

•**Distal** (Type I): defective distal H+ secretion

1°, autoimmune (Sjögren’s, RA, SLE), hypercalciuria, meds (ampho, Li, ifosfamide); normally a/w ↓ K; if with ↑ K → sickle cell, obstruction, renal transplant

•**Hypoaldo** (Type IV): hypoaldo → ↑ K → ↓ NH3 synthesis → ↓ urine acid-carrying capacity

↓ renin: diabetic nephropathy, NSAIDs, chronic interstitial nephritis, calcineurin inh, HIV

↓ aldo production: 1° AI, ACEI/ARBs, heparin, severe illness, inherited (↓ 21-hydroxylase)

↓ response to aldosterone

meds: K-sparing diuretics, TMP-SMX, pentamidine, calcineurin inhibitors

tubulointerstitial disease: sickle cell, SLE, amyloid, DM

•Combined (Type III): rarely discussed or clinically relevant, also called juvenile RTA, has distal & proximal features, can be due to carbonic anhydrase II deficiency

a Urine pH will rise above 5.3 in the setting of HCO3 load

b FeHCO3 should be checked after an HCO3 load

c See above for causes of distal RTA (Type I) associated with hyperkalemia

### 治療 of severe metabolic acidoses (pH <**7.2)** (_Nat Rev Nephrol_ 2012;8:589)

•DKA: insulin, IVF, K repletion (_NEJM_ 2015;372:546); AKA: dextrose, IVF, replete K, Mg, PO4

•Lactic acidosis: treat underlying condition, avoid vasoconstrictors, avoid “Type B” meds

•Renal failure: hemodialysis

•Methanol & ethylene glycol: fomepizole (20 mg/dL), vit. B1 & B6 (ethylene glycol), folate (methanol), dialysis (if AKI, VS unstable, vision Δ or >50 mg/dL) (_NEJM_ 2018;378:270)

•Alkali therapy: if pH <7.1 or <7.2 and co-existing AKI (_Lancet_ 2018;392:21)

•NaHCO3: amps by IV push or infusion of three 50-mmol amps in 1 L D5W if less urgent

can estimate mmol of HCO3 needed as [desired-current HCO3]serum × wt (kg) × 0.4

side effects: ↑ volume, ↑ Na, ↓ ICa, ↑ PaCO2 (& ∴ intracellular acidosis; ∴ _must ensure adequate ventilation_ to blow off CO2)
