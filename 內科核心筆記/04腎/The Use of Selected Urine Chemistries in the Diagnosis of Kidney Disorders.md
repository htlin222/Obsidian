### Causes of AKI where urine sodium concentration and fractional excretion of sodium may be initially reduced, only to later increase. 
In these conditions, the GFR is reduced because of activation of systemic and/or intrakidney vasoconstrictors causing a reduction in filtered load of sodium at a time when tubular function is relatively intact. As the insult persists, tubular injury becomes more widespread, resulting in an increase in **結論大概是：當aki的時候，尿鈉的濃度會上升，因為腎臟失去了回收尿的能力** urine sodium concentration and fractional excretion of sodium.
