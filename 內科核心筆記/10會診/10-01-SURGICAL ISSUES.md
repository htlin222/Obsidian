Pain due to pancreatitis and nephrolithiasis commonly radiates to the back

### Figure 10-1 原因 of abdominal pain based on location

Initial evaluation

• History: onset of pain, location, exacerbating/relieving factors

• Assoc. sx: fevers/chills, N/V, Δ in bowel habits (diarrhea/constipation, stool diam. or color, hematochezia, melena), jaundice, Δ in urine color, Δ in wt, menstrual hx in women

• PMHx: previous incisions or abdominal surgeries; Ob/Gyn hx

• Exam: VS; general posture of Pt; comprehensive abdominal exam looking for signs of peritonitis, which include rebound tenderness and involuntary guarding, abdominal wall rigidity, pain with percussion/minimal palpation; presence of hernias; rectal/pelvic

• Labs: CBC, electrolytes, LFTs, amylase/lipase, pregnancy test

• Imaging: depends on suspected etiology, may include RUQ U/S for biliary/hepatic disease, KUB for intestinal obstruction, CT for pancreatitis or intestinal disease. Do not delay resuscitation or surgical consultation for ill Pt while waiting for imaging.

ACUTE ABDOMEN

定義

• Acute onset abdominal pain that portends need for urgent surgery

原因

• Perforated viscus → peritonitis (perforated ulcer, complicated diverticulitis, trauma)

• Intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleed (also see “Acute Aortic Syndromes”)

• Bowel obstruction (adhesions from previous surgeries, malignancies, hernias)

• Acute mesenteric ischemia (esp if afib, “pain out of proportion to exam”)

• Mimics: severe pancreatitis can resemble peritonitis; renal colic causes severe abdominal pain but not abdominal rigidity

Initial evaluation

• H&P as above

• Labs as above plus: PT/INR, PTT, lactate, type & screen (crossmatch if active bleeding)

• Imaging: KUB (upright) or if stable, CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast (IV/PO if suspect obstruction)

Initial management

• Immediate surgical consultation for suspected acute abdomen

• NPO, start IV fluids (NS or LR), Foley, NGT placement if obstruction suspected

• Broad spectrum 抗生素 if perforation suspected

EXTREMITY EMERGENCIES

Acute limb ischemia (see “Peripheral Artery Disease” for details)

• 定義: sudden ↓ in perfusion causing threat to limb viability

• Eval: detailed vascular exam (incl. pulses & Doppler signals, motor/sensory function); CTA

• Initial management: anticoag for embolism/thrombosis (heparin dose 80 U/kg bolus, then 18 U/kg drip); immediate surgical consultation

Compartment syndrome (_Clin Orthop Relat Res_ 2010;468:940)

• 定義: ↑ intracompartmental pressure with compressive closure of venules → ↑ hydrostatic force resulting in further increases in compartment pressure

• 原因: orthopedic (fracture), vascular (ischemia-reperfusion), iatrogenic (eg, vascular injury in anticoagulated Pt), soft tissue injury (eg, prolonged limb compression)

• 臨床表現: pain esp. on passive movement, swollen/tense compartment, paraesthesia, pallor, pulselessness, paralysis (late)

• Evaluation: surgical evaluation of compartment pressures; intracompartment pressure >30 or difference between diastolic & intracompartment pressure of >10–30 is diagnostic

• 治療: fasciotomy

SURGICAL TUBES, DRAINS, WOUNDS

Tracheostomy (_Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg_ 2013;148:6)

• Typically a cuffed tube, which creates a tight seal to facilitate ventilation throughout tube

• Speaking valve (eg, Passy-Muir): 1-way valve that allows inhalation through tube, but exhalation around tube through vocal cords (nb, cuff should not be inflated)

• 1st routine tube Δ for _percutaneously_ placed tubes should be ~10 d postop; _surgically_ placed tubes can be Δ’d >5 d postop; first Δ should be overseen by experienced person

• Accidental dislodgement: intubate from above (if airway/vent nec & anatomically possible)

w/in 7 d of placement: emergent surgical consultation

\>7 d after placement: replace with a similar size tube or smaller

Chest tubes (_Eur J Cardiothorac Surg_ 2011;40:291)

• Inserted for PTX, chest trauma or after thoracic surg for drainage of air/ fluid from thoracic cavity. Range from small (8-10 Fr for spont PTX) to large (28-32 Fr after pulm resections)

• Connected to 3-chamber chest drainage system:

1st: collection chamber for pleural fluid

2nd: water seal chamber used to allow air to exit pleural space on exhalation and prevent air from entering on inhalation

3rd: suction control chamber which regulates suction transmitted to pleural space

• Monitor for output and presence of air leak (indicated by bubbling in _water seal chamber_)

• Removal determined by overall daily outputs and presence of air leak

• If accidentally removed or dislodged, tube should be completely removed and an occlusive dressing (eg, 4 × 4 covered with Tegaderm or silk tape) should be placed _rapidly_ over site. CXR STAT; new tube should be placed if persistent PTX.

Gastrostomy/jejunostomy tubes (_Paediatr Child Health_ 2011;16:281)

• Placed for tube feedings, hydration, and delivery of medications

• Should not be removed for ≥6–8 wk to allow establishment of mature gastrocutaneous tract

• Obstructed tubes can be cleared by flushing with agents such as carbonated water, meat tenderizer, & pancreatic enzymes. ↓ obstruction by flushing before & after meds and flushing q4–6h when receiving continuous feeds.

• Inadvertent removal: place Foley catheter of similar size or smaller into tract _immediately_ to prevent stoma from closing. Tube then replaced and confirmed via fluoro study.

Suture/staple removal

• Should be done in consultation with surgical team; timing depends on location of wound

• _Should not be removed if there is evidence of wound separation during removal!_

• After removal, wound should be reapproximated with Steri-Strips

Decubitus ulcers (_J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs_ 2012;39:3)

• Sores in dependent areas exposed to repeated pressure (commonly sacrum, heels)

• Risk factors: immobility, poor nutritional status

• Stage I (non-blanchable erythema); Stage II (partial thickness); Stage III (full-thickness skin loss); Stage IV (full-thickness tissue loss)

• 治療: offload area, air mattress, pillows and/or support boots, nutritional support

• Surgical consultation for debridement of ulcers with necrotic or infected tissue, may require plastic surgical reconstruction for advanced ulcers once clean

MAXIMIZING A SURGICAL CONSULT

• For ill Pt, call surgical consult early, do not wait for labs & imaging results

• If potential surgical emergency, make Pt NPO, start IVF, ✔ coags, type, & screen

• Have appropriate-level MD who knows & has examined Pt call consult
