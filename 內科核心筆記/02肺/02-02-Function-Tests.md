# PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (肺功能)

• **Spirometry:** evaluate for obstructive disease

Flow-volume loops: diagnose and/or localize obstruction

Bronchodilator: indicated if obstruction at baseline or asthma clinically suspected

Methacholine challenge: helps dx asthma if spirometry 正常, > 20% ↓ FEV1 → asthma

• **Lung volumes:** evaluate for hyperinflation or restrictive disease including NM causes

• **DLCO:** evaluates functional surface area for gas exchange; helps differentiate causes of obstructive and restrictive diseases and screens for vascular disease & early ILD

FEV1/FVC LLN typically 0.75. DLCO can be diminished due to secondary atelectasis.
