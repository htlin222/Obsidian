• **A-a gradient** = **PAO2 – PaO2:** normal (_on room air_) = “4 + age/4” or “2.5 + (0.2 × age)”

• Hypoxemia + 正常 A-a gradient: problem is ↓ PiO2/FiO2 or ↑ PaCO2 (ie, hypoventilation)

• Hypoxemia + ↑ A-a gradient: problem is either

R → L shunt, anatomic (congenital heart dis) or severe pathophys (alveoli filled with fluid; eg, PNA, pulm edema); cannot overcome with 100% O2 b/c of sigmoidal Hb-O2 curve

V/Q mismatch where “shunt-like” areas (↓ V & 正常 Q) cause unoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenated blood; can be overcome with ↑ O2 delivery

Diffusion limitation: generally seen with exercise/↑CO

• **Cyanosis:** seen when >4 g/dL of reduced Hb in blood vessels of skin/mucous membranes central: ↓ SaO2 (pulm disease, shunt); 異常 Hb \[metHb, sulfHb, COHb (not true cyanosis)\] peripheral: ↓ blood flow → ↑ O2 extraction (eg, ↓ CO, cold, arterial or venous obstruction)

CO binds to Hb more avidly than does O2. Pulse oximeter (Ox) misreads COHb as HbO2 → falsely 正常 sat.

Oxidizing drugs Δ Hb (ferrous) to MetHb (ferric), which cannot carry O2. Pulse ox misreads MetHb as HbO2.

Cyanide inhibits mitochondrial O2 use → cellular hypoxia but pink skin and ↑ _venous_ O2 sat.

↑ VCO2 typically transient cause of ↑ PaCO2; Ddx: exercise, fever, hyperthyroidism, ↑ work of breathing, ↑ carbs.
