# LUNG TRANSPLANT

## Overview

• Indications: end stage, progressive decline despite max medical Rx, <2-y life expectancy; COPD, ILD (IPF), pulmonary HTN, cystic fibrosis, alpha 1-antitrypsin

• Contraindic: age >65 (rel.), uncontrolled/unRx’d infxn, malig in prior 2 y, severe non-pulm dis., BMI ≥35, active smoking, EtOH/drug depend., med noncompliance, psychosocial

## Posttransplant care

• Immunosuppression: center dependent; no single best regimen. Tacro > cyclosporine (↓ incidence of acute rejection) + steroids + MMF/azathioprine

• Monitoring: clinic visits, serial 肺功能, chest X-ray, bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy

## Complications

• Primary graft dysfunction (PGD): acute lung injury following txp; assoc with early mortality

• Anastomotic: vascular (stenosis, thrombosis) and airway (infection, necrosis, dehiscence, granulation tissue, tracheobronchomalacia, stenosis, fistula)

• Acute rejection: ↓ lung fxn, cough, SOB, fever; Dx with trans-bronch bx; Rx immunosupp

• Chronic rejection: bronchiolitis obliterans with obstruction; Dx with 肺功能, trans-bronch bx; Rx limited (azithromycin, montelukast, Δ immunosuppressives)

• Infection: ↑ bacterial, fungal, viral pneumonia, systemic infections, CMV, OI

• Malignancy: 2× ↑ risk overall. 5.5× ↑ risk lung cancer. PTLD (assoc with EBV) common.

• Misc: GVHD, CKD, DM, CAD, CHF, stroke, encephalopathy, drug toxicity
