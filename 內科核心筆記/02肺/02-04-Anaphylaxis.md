# ANAPHYLAXIS

## 定義 and 病生理 (_Ann Emerg Med_ 2006;47:373)

• Severe, rapid onset (mins to hrs), potentially life-threatening systemic allergic response

• IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation with release of histamine, tryptase, and TNF

• Precipitates systemic reactions (bronchospasm, tissue swelling, fluid shifts, vasodilation)

• Common triggers: penicillins, cephalosporins, shellfish, nuts, insect stings, IV contrast (not truly an IgE-mediated mechanism, but clinically similar)

## Diagnosis: any of the three following criteria

1) Acute illness with skin ± mucosal involvement (rash, flushing, hives), AND at least one of:

Respiratory compromise (wheeze, stridor, dyspnea, hypoxemia)

Hypotension or hypoperfusion (syncope, incontinence)

2) Two or more of the following after exposure to a **likely** allergen: skin/mucosal involvement, respiratory compromise, ↓ BP or hypoperfusion, GI symptoms

3) Hypotension after exposure to **known** allergen for that Pt

## 治療

• **Epi:** IM 0.3–0.5 mL of 1:1000 dilution q5–20min; gtt at 0.1 mcg/kg/min if HoTN; avoid IVB

• **Airway:** suppl O2 ± intubation or cricothyroidotomy (if laryngeal edema); β2\-agonists

• Fluid resuscitation with ≥1–2 L crystalloid (may extravasate up to 35% of intravasc volume)

• Antihistamines relieve hives & itching, _no effect on airway or hemodynamics_; H1RA (diphenhydramine 50 mg IV/IM) ± H2RA (ranitidine 50 mg IV)

• Steroids without immediate effect but may help prevent relapse: methylpred 125 mg IV q6h

• Avoid unopposed α-adrenergic vasopressors

## Disposition

• Mild rxn limited to urticaria or mild bronchospasm can be observed for ≥6 h; admit all others

• Watch for **biphasic reaction;** occurs in 23%, typically within 8–10 h but up to 72 h

## Angioedema (_J Allergy Clin Immunol_ 2013;131:1491)

• Localized swelling of skin/mucosa; involves face, lips, tongue, uvula, larynx, and bowels

• 原因: mast cell-mediated (eg, NSAIDs); bradykinin-mediated (eg, **ACEi**, ARNi, hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency); idiopathic

• Diagnosis: C4 and C1 inhibitor level, tryptase (if suspect anaphylaxis), ESR/CRP

• Rx: intubation if risk of airway compromise. Allergic angioedema: H1/H2 antihist., steroids.

If 2° ACEi: d/c ACEi, antihist., icatibant (bradykinin-receptor antag; _NEJM_ 2015;372:418).

Hereditary angioedema: plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (_NEJM_ 2010;363:513), ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor; _NEJM_ 2010;363:523).
