# SOFT TISSUE AND BONE INFECTIONS

SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS (SSTI; _CID_ 2014;59:e10)

Clinical

• **Cellulitis:** infxn of dermis/sc fat, with erythema, edema, warmth, pain (rubor, tumor, calor, dolor)

• **Erysipelas:** infxn of upper dermis (more superficial than cellulitis), often caused by strep, with raised erythematous lesion with clear demarcation from normal skin

• **Impetigo:** infxn of superficial layers, often caused by staph, typically in children, with purulent lesions, often on face/extrem, ± bullae, ± gold crust

• **Lymphangitis:** proximal red streaking ± regional lymphadenopathy

• **Toxic shock syndrome** can occur with staph or strep infxn. Fever, HA, N/V, diarrhea, myalgias, pharyngitis, diffuse rash with desquamation, HoTN, shock. BCx may be ⊖.

Microbiology (_CID_ 2014;59:e10)

• Primarily strep and staph, including MRSA; may include GNRs in diabetics/immunosupp.

• **MRSA** (_NEJM_ 2005;352:1485 & 2006;355:666) causes up to 75% of purulent skin/soft tissue infxns, depending on local epi (rapidly increasing), often assoc. with purulent drainage or exudate. Often TMP-SMX sensitive; variably clindamycin sensitive (may falsely appear susceptible on lab testing, requires confirmation with D-test; _NEJM_ 2007;357:380).

• Bites: **skin (strep, staph)** and **oral flora** (incl anaerobes) + special exposures:

\*Cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella acquired via cat scratch or bite. Results in lymphadenitis.

Diagnosis

• Largely 臨床diagnosis; BCx low yield (~5–10%) but useful if ⊕

• Aspirate of bulla or pus from furuncle or pustule may provide microbiologic dx

Mild: no systemic signs of infection; moderate: systemic signs; severe: SIRS or immunocompromised

• **Limb elevation;** erythema may _worsen_ after starting 抗生素 b/c bacterial killing → inflam.

• In obese 病人, adequate drug dosing important to avoid 治療 failure (_J Infect_ 2012;2:128)

• **Duration:** 5 to up to 14 d. Take pictures & draw margins to track progress.

NECROTIZING SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS (_NEJM_ 2017;377:2253)

定義

• Includes cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, myonecrosis (gas gangrene).

• Fulminant tissue destruction, systemic toxicity & high mortality. **Surgical emergency**.

Risk factors

• Can affect healthy individuals via skin/mucosal breach or traumatic wound, but ↑ risk with DM, PVD, EtOH abuse, IVDU, cirrhosis, or other immunosupp.

Microbiology

• **Necrotizing fasciitis**

• Type I: polymicrobial (mixed aerobes & anaerobes), typically in older 病人 with above RFs. **Fournier’s gangrene** involves genitalia and/or perineum

• Type II: monomicrobial, usually group A strep, less likely _Staph, Vibrio, Aero._; a/w TSS

• **Clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene):** _C. perfringens; C. septicum_ (large Gram ⊕ rods with blunt ends on gram stain). A/w traumatic wounds that create an anaerobic environment ideal for _Clostridia_.

臨床表現

• Erythema, edema, warmth + **systemic illness** (fever, hemodynamic instability) **± crepitus**

• **Rapid progression** of 臨床signs

• May see bullae, change in skin color (purple-red to blue-gray)

• **Pain out of proportion** to apparent cellulitis; skin hyperesthetic and later anesthetic

Diagnosis

• 臨床dx sufficient to initiate **urgent surgical exploration**

• Aspiration of necrotic center; BCx; Gram stain; lactic acid and CK for tissue necrosis

• Imaging: **noncontrast CT**, but do not delay Rx/surgery (_Arch Surg_ 2010;145:452)

• Microbiologic dx from Gram stain and culture of surgical specimens

治療 (_CID_ 2014;60:169)

• Urgent surgical exploration with debridement of necrotic tissue

• Antibiotics: \[vancomycin or linezolid\] + \[pip/tazo or carbapenem\] + clinda for toxin inhibition Consider vanc + cefepime + metronidazole + clinda to avoid nephrotoxicity from pip/tazo Consider IVIG for GAS toxic shock; consult ID

DIABETIC FOOT INFECTIONS

_Leading cause of DM-related hosp. days & nontrauma amputations_

Microbiology and severity

• **Mild** (superficial ulcer, no involvement of deeper structures, erythema <2 cm): usually _S. aureus_ or aerobic streptococci

• **Moderate** (ulcer with involvement of deeper structures, erythema >2 cm): more likely to be chronic and polymicrobial (PsA, enterococci, _Enterobacter_, anaerobes)

• **Severe** (moderate + systemic sx infx): anaerobic streptococci, _Bacteroides_, _Clostridium_

Initial evaluation

• Cleanse, debride, probe, and obtain deep anaerobic + aerobic cultures

• Assess for PVD: sensation, pulses, ABIs

Diagnosis

• **Deep tissue wound cx** at time of debridement (ideally prior to antibiotics). Avoid superficial swabs (_only_ helpful if ⊕ for _S. aureus_ and mild infxn).

• For mod/severe: obtain blood cx, ESR, CRP

• **Osteomyelitis should always be ruled out.** At ↑ risk if: grossly visible bone or able to probe to bone, ulcer >2 cm, ulcer duration >1–2 wk, ESR >70. If suspicious for osteo, obtain plain films ± MRI (see below).

治療 (_CID_ 2012;54:e132)

• **Mild infxn:** oral 抗生素. Target skin flora (diclox, cephalexin, or amox/clav); use TMP-SMX or doxy for MRSA.

• **Mod/severe infxn:** IV 抗生素. Target GPCs (vano, linezolid, or dapto) + GNRs (CTX, levo, or amp/sulb) ± anaerobes (metronidazole or clinda). Add PsA coverage (cefepime or pip-tazo) if: severe, immunocomp, neutropenic, water exposure, burn, puncture, nosocomial.

• Elevation, non–weight-bearing status, wound care, glycemic control, Rx for venous insufficiency and arterial ischemia

• **Many require surgery:** early, aggressive and repeated debridement; revascularization or amputation may be necessary

OSTEOMYELITIS

_Infection of bone due to hematogenous seeding or direct spread from contiguous focus_

Microbiology (_Lancet_ 2004;364:369)

• **Hematogenous: _S. aureus_**; mycobacterial infection of vertebral body = Pott’s disease

• **Contiguous focus** (may be acute or chronic)

open fracture, orthopedic surgery, etc.: **_S. aureus_** and **_S. epi_**

skin breakdown + vasc. insuffic. (eg, diabetic foot): **polymicrobial**

GU source (GNR, _Enterococcus_)

臨床表現

• Surrounding soft tissue compromise ± fistula to superficial skin

• ± Fever, malaise, and night sweats (more common in hematogenous than contiguous)

• Vertebral osteomyelitis (esp. IVDU): unremitting, focal back pain, usually febrile (_NEJM_ 2010;362:1022)

Diagnosis (_JAMA_ 2008;299:806)

• Goal is to obtain cx data of causative organism to avoid long-term empiric 抗生素

• **Bone biopsy** or **tissue cx** obtained surgically or via percutaneous biopsy (aspiration bx Se 30–74%) unless ⊕ blood cx. Do not rely on swabs of ulcers or fistulae drainage.

• Physical exam: high suspicion in diabetic foot (see above) if can probe ulcer to bone or ulcer >2 cm2 (Sp 83%, 90% PPV)

• **Blood cultures before antibiotics** (more often ⊕ with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis)

• CBC, CRP, ESR (>70 greatly ↑ likelihood of osteo; _JAMA_ 2008;299:806)

• Imaging

Plain radiographs: normal early in disease; lytic lesions seen after 2–6 wk

**MRI:** most sensitive imaging study (overall Se 90%, Sp 82%; _Archives_ 2007;167:125)

CT: can demonstrate periosteal reaction and cortical and medullary destruction

CT & MRI very Se but ↓ Sp; false ⊕ if contig focus with periosteal reaction, Charcot Δs

Radionuclide imaging: very Se but non-Sp (false ⊕ if soft tissue inflammation)

治療

• **Antibiotics:** based on cx data. Duration depends on Rx strategy/goals of Rx management (eg, 6 wks for vertebral osteo; _Lancet_ 2015;385:875). After ≥7 days from either start of IV 抗生素 or surgery, if doing well consider (in consultation with ID!) Δ’ing IV to PO (if good bioavailability and bone penetration) (_NEJM_ 2019;380:425).

• **Surgery** should be considered for any of the following: acute osteo that fails to respond to medical Rx, chronic osteo, complications of pyogenic vertebral osteo (eg, neurologic compromise, spinal instability, epidural abscess) or infected prosthesis

EPIDURAL ABSCESS

Etiology

• Hematogenous spread (2/3): skin infection, soft tissue (dental abscess) or endocarditis

• Direct extension (⅓): vertebral osteo, sacral ulcer, spinal anesthesia or surgery, LP

• Risk factors: diabetes, renal failure, alcoholism, IVDU, immunosupp.

• **_S. aureus_** most common pathogen, increasing incidence of MRSA

臨床表現

• **Back pain** (unremitting including midline) + often **fever** ± nerve root or cord signs

Diagnostic studies

• **MRI**

• Aspiration of abscess fluid for Gram stain & cx or operative Gram stain & cx

• Blood cx (frequently ⊖)

治療

• **Antibiotics** ± **surgery** (decompressive laminectomy and debridement) for failure to improve on medical Rx. Emergent surgery for early signs and symptoms of cord compression (w/ vertebral osteo and epidural abscess, may see paraplegia 48–72 h after first signs)
