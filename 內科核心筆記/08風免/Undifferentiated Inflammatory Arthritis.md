* Evaluation
	- distribution of joints involved and presence of joint swelling
	-  cutaneous, nail, and hair abnormalities (such as sclerodactyly, rash, alopecia) and their distribution
	- Raynaud phenomenon
	- tendon involvement
	- lymphadenopathy and organomegaly
	- ocular involvement
	- pulmonary abnormalities
	- muscle weakness of limbs, head, neck, and pharynx
	- abdominal symptoms (such as hematochezia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain)
	- recent travel, joint injury, or infections (including sexually transmitted infections)

[[Examination of the Hand and Wrist]]

### Diagnostic Tests
* Standard laboratory tests
	* Complete blood examination
	- Biochemistry
	- Liver function tests
	- C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
	- Urine: microscopy, culture and sensitivities, cell count, red cell morphology
	- Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
	- Creatine kinase
* Autoantibody tests
	- Rheumatoid factor
	- Antiâ€“cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies
	- Antinuclear antibodies
	- Antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens
	- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)
* Imaging
	- Plain radiographs of affected joints
	- Chest radiograph
	- Ultrasonography of affected joints
	- MRI of affected joints
- Other
	- Pulmonary function tests
	- Transthoracic echocardiography
	- Arthrocentesis with synovial fluid analysis 
		- (cell count with differential, gram stain, microscopy, culture and sensitivities, crystal identification by polarized microscopy
