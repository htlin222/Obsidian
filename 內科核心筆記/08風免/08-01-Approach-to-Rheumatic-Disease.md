# Approach to patient with joint pain
* **Articular** 🆚 **periarticular** (bursitis, tendinitis) source of pain: typically active ROM more painful than passive ROM in periarticular process
* 對於關節痛，可以分成關節內跟關節外的，如果是被動在痛的，常常是關節外的。

* **Inflammatory** 🆚 **noninflammatory** pain: _features of inflammatory pain_ include 
	* swelling, 腫
	* warmth or redness in specific joint,  熱紅
	* 🚨 注意 prolonged morning stiffness (>30 min), 超過30分鐘的晨僵
	* improvement of pain/stiffness with motion/exercise. 動一動會好一點
	* Assess for extra-articular features.
* Physical exam: 
	* localize complaint, 
	* identify objective signs of inflammation, 
	* and assess number and pattern of affected joints
* The physical exam is only _50–70% sensitive_ for detecting inflammatory arthritis

🅰️ May initially present as arthralgia without overt arthritis. 
🅱️Range of motion of joint or joint a/w bursa or tendon.

一般來說，首先先分別是長還是短的時間，有沒有發炎反應

*WBC count of aspirated fluid in septic bursitis often < WBC count in septic arthritis.

## 🌠 影像檢查    Radiologic features of major arthritis

* **OA:** 
	* plain films: asym joint space narrowing (JSN), **osteophytes**, subchondral sclerosis & cysts; 
	* subchondral “gull-wing” erosions may be seen in less-common erosive OA; 
	* MRI may show early disease not seen on plain films; 
	* U/S ≈ MRI for structural damage ⊖

* **RA:** plain films: 
	* symmetric JSN, early = periarticular **osteopenia;** 
	* late = marginal **erosions**; subluxations; MRI & U/S can detect early and sub臨床disease; MRI ≈ U/S for erosions

* **Gout:** plain films: 
	* early = nonspec swelling; 
	* late = **tophus**, joint erosions with overhanging edges; 
	* U/S for detection of microtophi (double-contour sign); 
	* dual-energy CT (⭐️DECT): identify articular/periarticular UrA deposits vs. calcium deposits; MRI ≈ U/S for erosions

* **Spondyloarthritis:** evidence of **sacroiliitis**: plain films: early = pseudo-widening SI joint space, late = sclerosis, erosions, **ankylosis;** SI MRI ↑ Se for early Δ; U/S ≈ MRI to detect enthesitis

# INFLAMMATORY MARKER & AUTOANTIBODY TESTING
## Inflammatory markers (_Mod Rheumatol_ 2009;19:469)
| marker | content |     | 
| ------ | ------- | --- |
| **ESR:** |_indirect_ measure of inflammation [↑ RBC aggregation due to acute-phase proteins (fibrinogen & Ig) in blood]; <br> slow to rise; may ↑ with age, preg., anemia, obesity. Ddx for >100: malig. esp. MM, lymphoma; GCA or other vasculitis; ESRD; endocarditis, TB, osteo.
| **CRP:** |_direct_ measure of inflammation (protein produced by liver, part of innate immune system); <br>_typically rises and falls before the ESR_ with 治療/resolution of process

# Autoantibody testing (_Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol_ 2014;28:907)
* ANA (anti-nuclear Ab): _screening test_ for Ab directed against nuclear proteins; found in autoimmune conditions; most useful in testing for suspected connective tissue diseases

* Order ANA only when _臨床suspicion for CTD_ b/c nonspecific: 1:40 (very low ⊕, 25–30% of healthy 病人); 1:80 (low ⊕, 10–15% of healthy 病人); ≥1:160 (⊕, 5% of healthy 病人). May be ⊕ in 病人 prior to clin manifest (_NEJM_ 2003;349:1526; _Arthritis Res Ther_ 2011;13:1).

* If ANA ⊕ and high 臨床suspicion for CTD, consider testing for Ab against dsDNA, Smith, Ro/La, RNP, Scl-70 and myositis-specific Abs (_highly specific_ for various CTD)

* ANA does _not_ correlate well with disease activity, ∴ no 臨床value in serial testing

* “False ⊕” ANA: AIH, PBC, thyroid disease, certain infxns and malignancies, IBD, IPF

* RF and anti-CCP (see “Rheumatoid Arthritis”)
