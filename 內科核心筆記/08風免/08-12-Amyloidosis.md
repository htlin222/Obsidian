Diagnostic studies

•Biopsy (abdominal SC fat pad, rectal, or affected tissue) → apple-green birefringence on **Congo red stain;** fat pad bx Se 60–85%, Sp 90–100%

•If suspect AL → ✔ SIEP & UIEP (↑ Se vs. SPEP & UPEP) & free light chains, ± BM bx

•If suspect renal involvement ✔ U/A for proteinuria

•If suspect cardiac involvement ✔ ECG (↓ voltage, conduction 異常), TTE (biventricular valve leaflet & interatrial septum thickening), ↑ wall without ↑ volt has 75% Se, 95% Sp; MRI

•Genetic testing for hereditary forms

•Clearance of amyloid by Ab against serum amyloid P under study (_NEJM_ 2015;373:1106)

•Cardiac involvement: diuretics; avoid dig, CCB, and vasodilators; ? ICD for 1° prevention

•Heart, kidney, and liver Tx may be considered in those with advanced disease

•Median survival: 12–18 mo for AL (~6 if cardiac); 11 y for AA; variable for others
