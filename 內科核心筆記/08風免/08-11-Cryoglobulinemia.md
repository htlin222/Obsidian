定義 & types (_Lancet_ 2012;379:348; _Oncology_ 2013;37:1098)

•Cryoglobulins: proteins that **precipitate** from _serum or plasma_ **on exposure to cold and redissolve on rewarming**, characterized by their composition; a/w chronic immune stimulation and/or lymphoproliferation

•Distinguish from _cryofibrinogenemia_ = proteins (eg, fibrin, fibrinogen) that precipitate only from _plasma;_ found in autoimmune dis, malignancies, infxns; unclear 臨床significance

原因

•Hematologic diseases

Type I: multiple myeloma, MGUS, Waldenström’s, chronic lymphocytic leukemia

Type II: B-cell lymphomas, solid-organ malignancies

•Infections (types II & III): viral (**HCV** [>80% RNA ⊕], HBV, HIV, HAV, EBV, CMV), bacterial (endocarditis, strep, etc.), fungal (coccidiomycosis, etc.), parasitic (malaria, amoebiasis)

•Autoimmune syndromes (type III > II): **Sjögren’s syndrome**, SLE, RA, PAN

•Renal transplant recipients收件人 (_Clin Nephrol_ 2008;69:239)

•Essential (idiopathic) in 10% of cases

病生理

•Type I: cryo precipitation in microcirculation微循環 → **hyperviscosity** & **vascular occlusion**

•Types II/III: defective/insufficient immune complex (IC) clearance → IC-mediated inflammation of blood vessels with complement activation → **vasculitis**

臨床表現

•Most patients with circulating cryoglobulins冷凍球蛋白 are asx

•Type I: hyperviscosity (cold worsens sx) → H/A, visual disturbance, livedo, digital ischemia

•Type II/III: vasculitis (sx not affected by cold exposure)

“Meltzer’s triad” (purpura, arthralgias, weakness) seen in 25–30% of 病人

General: **weakness**, low-grade fever

Dermatologic (54–80%): lower extremity **purpura**, livedo reticularis, leg ulcers

Joint (44–70%): symmetric, migratory **arthralgias** of small or medium joints

Renal (50%): **glomerulonephritis** (proteinuria, hematuria, ARF, HTN, edema)

Neurologic (17–60%): **peripheral neuropathy** (polyneuropathy > mononeuritis multiplex)

Hematologic: anemia, thrombocytopenia, ↑ risk of B-cell lymphoma

GI (5%): abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal LFTs

Diagnostic studies

•✔ Cryoglobulins; must keep blood _warmed to 37_°_C at all times_ en route to lab; early cooling causes false ⊖ cryoglobulin, loss of RF and ↓↓ complement

•_Cryocrit_ is quantification of cryoprotein, does not always correlate with disease activity

•False ↑ in WBC or plt on automated CBC, due to cryoprecipitation

•Type I: ✔ serum viscosity, symptomatic if ≥4.0 centipoise; complement levels normal

•Type II: ↓ **C4 levels**, variable C3 levels, ↑ ESR, ⊕ rheumatoid factor (RF)

✔ **HCV, HBV, & HIV serologies** in all 病人 with mixed cryoglobulinemia

Bx of affected tissue: hyaline thrombi; vasculitis with mixed inflammatory infiltrates of small vessels; leukocytoclastic vasculitis in purpuric lesions

治療 (_Blood_ 2012;119:5996; _Medicine_ 2013;92:61)

•**Treat underlying disorder:**

Lymphoproliferative disease: chemotherapy and/or radiation

HCV: antivirals ± immunosuppression for severe disease (_NEJM_ 2013;369:1035)

Connective tissue–related disease: DMARD/steroids ± rituximab

•Type I: plasma exchange if hyperviscosity; steroids, alkylating agents, rituximab, chemo

•Type II: NSAIDs for control of mild symptoms for 病人 with normal renal function.

Rituximab or cyclophosphamide for major organ involvement. For mixed cryo, plasmapheresis or plasma exchange only in severe, life-threatening disease.
