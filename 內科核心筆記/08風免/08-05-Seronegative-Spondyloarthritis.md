定義 and classification system (_NEJM_ 2016;374:2563)

•Spondyloarthritis (SpA): group of inflammatory disorders that share common 臨床表現: inflammatory spine disease, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis (see below), and extra-articular 表現 (primarily ocular and skin disease)

•Seronegative = absence of autoantibodies

•Subtypes: ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis (ReA), IBD-associated arthritis, juvenille SpA and undifferentiated

流行病學 & pathogenesis (_Nat Rev Rheumatol_ 2015;11:110)

•Prevalence 0.5–2% worldwide; AS and non-radiographic axial SpA most common

•HLA-B27 accounts for ~30% of attributable genetic risk but not required for diagnosis

•Environmental factors likely critical for disease, esp reactive arthritis (ie, infection)

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) 流行病學 and Key Presentation Features
![](https://i.imgur.com/eI2j4jy.png)
[*](part0013.html#st15)GU: Chlamydia, Ureaplasma urealyticum; GI: Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, C. diff.

Major 臨床表現 (_Lancet_ 2017;390:73)

•**Inflammatory back pain:** SI joints (**sacroiliitis**), apophyseal joints of spine

characterized by **IPAIN** (Insidious onset, Pain at night, Age of onset <40 y, Improves with exercise/hot water, No improvement with rest), a.m. stiffness, _responsive to NSAIDs_

•**Peripheral arthritis:** typically asymmetric, oligoarticular, large joints, lower > upper limbs; however, can be symmetric & polyarticular (thus, mimic RA), espec. in psoriatic arthritis

•**Enthesitis:** inflammation at site of tendon/ligament insertion into bone, esp Achilles, plantar fascia (calcaneal insertion), pre-patellar, elbow epicondyles

•**Rigidity of spine:** bamboo spine by X-ray, ankylosis due to progressive growth of bony spurs that bridge intervertebral disc

•**Dactylitis:** “sausage digit,” inflammation of entire digit (joint + tenosynovial inflamm)

•**Uveitis:** anterior uveitis _most common extra-articular manifestation_ in seronegative SpA_;_ usually unilateral and 表現為 pain, red eye, blurry vision, photophobia

•Subtypes also distinguished by _axial_ vs _peripheral_ predominant involvement

臨床assessment (_Nat Rev Rheumatol_ 2012;8:253)

•**Seronegative:** notable for _absence_ of rheumatoid factor or autoantibodies; ± ↑ESR/CRP

•**HLA-B27:** nonspecific, b/c common in general population (6–8%); most useful when high 臨床suspicion but 正常 imaging; ⊕ 90% of 病人 with AS, but only 20–80% in other SpA

•**Axial disease physical exam**

The following are not specific PEx findings but useful in monitoring disease during Rx:

Lumbar flexion deformity assessed by **modified Schober’s test** (⊕ if <5 cm ↑ in distance between a point 5 cm below the lumbosacral jxn and another point 10 cm above, when going from standing to maximum forward flexion)

T-spine mobility (extension) and kyphosis severity measured by **occiput-to-wall distance** (although occiput-to-wall distance also increased in osteoporotic kyphosis)

•**Infectious evaluation for reactive arthritis** (⊖ studies do not 排除)

**GU:** U/A, PCR of urine and/or genital swab for _Chlamydia;_ urethritis usually due to _Chlamydia_ infxn preceding arthritis, but can also see sterile urethritis post dysentery

**GI:** ✔ stool Cx, _C. diff_ toxin. Consider HIV in workup for reactive or psoriatic arthritis.

•**Radiology**

MRI preferred for _early_ detection of inflammation (sacroiliitis)

Plain films detect late structural changes (SI erosions/sclerosis)

Calcification of spinal ligaments with bridging symm syndesmophytes (“bamboo spine”)

Squaring and generalized demineralization of vertebral bodies (“shiny corners”)

Descriptions of skin 表現

•**Psoriasis:** erythematous plaques with sharply defined margins often with thick silvery scale

•**Circinate balanitis:** shallow, painless ulcers of glans penis and urethral meatus

•**Keratoderma blennorrhagica:** hyperkeratotic lesions on soles of feet, scrotum, palms, trunk, scalp

•**Erythema nodosum:** red tender nodules in subcutan. fat (panniculitis), typically on shins Ddx includes idiopathic, infxn, sarcoid, drug rxn, vasculitis, IBD, lymphoma

•**Pyoderma gangrenosum:** neutrophilic dermatosis → painful ulcers with violaceous border Ddx incl. idiopathic, IBD, RA, heme and solid malignancies, MGUS, MDS, polycyth. vera

Psoriatic arthritis subtypes (_NEJM_ 2017;376:957; 2018;391:2273 & 2285)

•**Monoarticula排除ligoarticular** (eg, large joint, DIP joint, dactylitic digit): most common initial manifestation

•**Polyarthritis** (small joints of the hands/feet, wrists, ankles, knees, elbows): indistinguishable from RA, but often asymmetric

•**Arthritis mutilans:** severe destructive arthritis with bone resorption, esp. hands

•**Axial disease:** unilateral/asymmetric sacroiliitis

•**DIP-limited:** good correlation with nail pitting and onycholysis

治療 approach (_Ann Rheum Dis_ 2012;71:319; _Arth Rheum_ 2016;68:282)

•Untreated disease may lead to irreversible structural damage and associated ↓ function

•Early physiotherapy beneficial

•Tight control of inflammation improves joint outcomes in PsA (_Lancet_ 2015;386:2489)

•**NSAIDs:** 1st line; rapidly ↓ stiffness and pain; prolonged, continuous administration may modify disease course but associated with GI and CV toxicity (_Cochrane Database Syst Rev_ 2015;17:CD010952); may exacerbate IBD

•**Intra-articular corticosteroids** in mono- or oligoarthritis; limited role for systemic steroids, esp. for axial disease

•**Conventional DMARDs** (eg, MTX, SAS, leflunomide): no efficacy for axial disease or enthesitis; may have role in peripheral arthritis, uveitis, and extra-articular 表現

•**Anti-TNFs:** effective for both axial and peripheral 表現, improves function and may slow progression of structural changes (_Curr Rheumatol Rep_ 2012;14:422); adalimumab or infliximab preferred if inflammatory eye disease

•**Anti-IL17A** (secukinumab, ixekizumab): for both axial and peripheral PsA & for ankylosing spondylitis (_NEJM_ 2015;373:1329 & 2534; _Lancet_ 2015;386:1137)

•**Anti-IL12/23** (ustekinumab): for both axial and peripheral PsA (_Ann Rheum Dis_ 2014;73:990)

•**PDE-4 inhibitor** (apremilast): peripheral arthritis in PsA (_Ann Rheum Dis_ 2014;73:1020); associated with GI side effects and significant wt loss

•**JAK inhibitor:** for anti-TNF resistant peripheral PsA (_NEJM_ 2017;377:1525)

•Psoriasis (skin) also responds to anti-TNF, anti-IL17A, anti-IL12/23, PDE-4 inhib, JAK inhib

•**Other:**

抗生素 in reactive arthritis if evidence of active infxn; consider prolonged 抗生素 for refractory _Chlamydia_ ReA (_Arthritis Rheum_ 2010;62:1298)

Involve ophthalmologist for any evidence of inflammatory eye disease (may benefit from steroid eye drops or intravitreal steroid injections)

Treat underlying IBD when appropriate
