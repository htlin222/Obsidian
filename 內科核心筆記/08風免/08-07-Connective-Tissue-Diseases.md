Centr, centromere; IM, inflammatory myopathies; RF, rheumatoid factor; Sm, Smith; SSc, systemic sclerosis; (_Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases_, 12th ed., 2001; _Lancet_ 2013;382:797)

•Only order auto-Ab testing if 臨床suspicion for CTD, the presence of auto-Ab withoutut characteristic 臨床findings ≠ diagnosis, and auto-Ab do not define a particular CTD

•Overlap syndromes may be reflected by multiple autoantibodies

_see “Systemic Lupus Erythematosus” and “Rheumatoid Arthritis” for those diseases_

SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS AND SCLERODERMA DISORDERS

定義 & 流行病學 (_Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol_ 2010;24:857)

•**Scleroderma** refers to the presence of tight, thickened skin

•**Localized scleroderma:** _morphea_ (plaques of fibrotic skin), _linear_ (fibrotic bands), “_en coup de saber_” (linear scleroderma on one side of scalp and forehead ≈ saber scar)

•**Systemic sclerosis (SSc)** = scleroderma + internal organ involvement

SSc with _limited cutaneous disease:_ formerly CREST syndrome (see below)

SSc with _diffuse cutaneous disease:_ often rapidly progressive disorder affecting skin

SSc _sine scleroderma_ (visceral disease withoutut skin involvement, rare)

•Peak onset of SSc between **ages 30–50;** ♀ > ♂ (7:1); African American > white

•1–2/100,000 annual incidence of systemic disease in the U.S.

•Pathogenesis: endothelial injury → ROS production → oxidative stress → perivascular inflammation → fibrosis. Cytokines, growth factors, genetics, environ. factors + antibodies (against PDGF receptor, endo. cells, fibroblasts) all contribute (_NEJM_ 2009;360:1989).

ACR/EULAR SSc classification criteria (_Ann Rheum Dis_ 2013;72:1747)

•Sufficient for dx: skin thickening of fingers of both hands extending proximal to MCPs

•Other items considered in criteria: Raynaud’s, SSc-related auto-Ab, pulm hypertension (PHT) and/or ILD, abnormal nailfold capillaries, telangiectasia, fingertip lesions (ulcers, scars), skin thickening limited to fingers (not beyond MCPs)

•**Rule out other causes** of thickened skin: diabetes (scleredema), scleromyxedema, toxin, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, eosinophilic fasciitis, amyloidosis, GVHD

Diagnostic studies & monitoring (_Semin Arthritis Rheum_ 2005;35:35)

•Autoantibodies: >95% 病人 with auto-Ab; generally mutually exclusive

⊕ **anti-Scl-70** (anti-topoisomerase 1): a/w diffuse SSc; ↑ risk pulm fibrosis

⊕ **anticentromere:** a/w limited SSc; ↑ risk of severe digit ischemia and PHT

⊕ **anti-RNA-Pol III:** a/w diffuse SSc; ↑ risk renal crisis; a/w cancer

⊕ ANA (>90%), ⊕ RF (30%), ⊕ anti-U1-RNP a/w overlap syndrome

Other: anti-Th/To (a/w limited SSc), U3-RNP (a/w ILD), PmScl (polymyositis-SSc overlap)

•CXCL4 levels reported to help diagnose disease and be correlated with degree of lung & skin fibrosis and disease progression but awaits validation (_NEJM_ 2014;370:433)

•At baseline: ✔ BUN/Cr & UA for proteinuria, 肺功能 (spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO), high-res chest CT (if diffuse disease), TTE (RVSP for PHT), RHC if ↑ RVSP or suspect PHT

•Annual 肺功能; TTE q1–2y

•Skin bx not routine, but helpful to assess other possible causes for skin thickening

•↑ risk of malignancy (esp. lung cancer) compared to general population, ∴ must be vigilant

•Frequent (eg, daily) BP ✔ to monitor for HTN suggestive of scleroderma renal crisis

治療 (_Arthritis Rheumatol_ 2018;70:1820)

•_Minimize steroid exposure to reduce risk of renal crisis_

•_Pulmonary_ fibrosis: **MMF** (_Lancet Respir Med_ 2016;4:708) vs. **cyclophosphamide** (NEJM 2006;354:2655); MMF + perfinidone under evaluation (_Rheum Dis Clin NA_ 2015;41:237)

PAH: **pulmonary vasodilators** (see “Pulm Hypertension”), early Rx a/w better outcomes

•Renal crisis: **ACEI** (not ARB) for Rx, not prophylaxis (_Semin Arthritis Rheum_ 2015;44:687)

•GI: PPI and/or H2-blockers for GERD; antibiotics for malabsorption

hypomotility: metoclopramide or erythromycin; nonoperative Rx of pseudo-obstruction

•Cardiac: NSAIDs ± colchicine superior to steroids for pericarditis

•Arthritis: acetaminophen, NSAIDs, hydroxychloroquine, MTX

•Myositis: MTX, AZA, steroids

•Skin: PUVA for morphea. Pruritus: emollients, topical or oral steroids (↓ dose). Fibrosis: MTX or MMF ? efficacy (_Ann Rheum Dis_ 2017;76:1207; _Int J Rheum Dis_ 2017;20:481)

•Auto-HSCT promising for severe disease (_NEJM_ 2018;378:35)

•Autoantibodies: ⊕ ANA (>75%) (_Curr Rheumatol Rep_ 2013;15:335)

⊕ **anti-Jo-1** (25%): most common specific Ab; a/w antisynthetase syndrome

⊕ anti-Mi-2 (DM > PM 15-20%) is a/w disease that responds well to steroids

⊕ anti-SRP is a/w NM, poor Rx response; ⊕ anti-HMGCR in NM a/w statin exposure

•Consider **EMG** (↑ spontaneous activity, ↓ amplitude, polyphasic potentials with contraction) or **MRI** (muscle edema, inflammation, atrophy) for evaluation; may guide biopsy

•**Pathology and muscle biopsy:** all with interstitial mononuclear infiltrates, muscle fiber necrosis, degeneration & regeneration (required for definitive diagnosis)

PM: _T cell–mediated muscle injury;_ endomysial inflam. surrounds non-necrotic fibers

DM: _immune complex deposition in blood vessels with complement_ activation; perimysial, perivascular inflam (B & CD4 T cells), complement in vessels.

NM: _necrotic fibers with macrophages_

IBM: _T cell–mediated muscle injury, vacuole formation;_ same as PM with eosinophilic inclusions and rimmed vacuoles (EM)

治療 (PM & DM, no effective 治療 for IBM) (_Autoimmun Rev_ 2011;11:6)

•**Steroids** (prednisone 1 mg/kg); MTX or AZA early if mod/severe or taper fails (2–3 mo)

•For resistant (30–40%) or severe disease: AZA/MTX combo, IVIg (DM ± PM), rituximab (_Arthritis Rheum_ 2013;65:314), MMF, cyclophosphamide (esp. if ILD or vasculitis)

•IVIg with pulse steroids acutely for life-threatening esophageal or resp muscle involvement

•✔ **for occult malignancy** (esp. if DM); monitor respiratory muscle strength with spirometry
