Adult-onset Still’s disease (_J Rheumatol_ 1992;19:424; _Autoimmun Rev_ 2014;13:708)

•**Rare autoinflammatory synd;** ♂ = ♀ with typical onset 16–35 y; sx evolve over wks to mos

•Dx if 5 criteria are present & ≥2 major; exclude infxn, malig, other rheumatic, drug rxn

**Major:** fever ≥39°C for ≥1 wk (usually daily or twice daily high-spiking fever); arthralgias/arthritis ≥2 wk; Still’s rash (qv); ↑ WBC with 80% PMN

**Minor:** sore throat; LAN; HSM; ↑ AST/ALT/LDH; negative ANA & RF

•Still’s rash (>85%): nonpruritic macular or maculopapular salmon-colored rash; usually trunk or extremities; may be precipitated by trauma (Koebner phenomenon), warm water

•Plain films: soft tissue swelling (_early_) → cartilage loss, erosions, carpal ankylosis (_late_)

•治療: NSAIDs; steroids; steroid-sparing (MTX, **anakinra**, anti-TNF, **tocilizumab**)

•Variable 臨床course: 20% with long-term remission; 30% remit-relapse; ~50% chronic (esp. arthritis); ↑ risk of macrophage activation syndrome (life threatening)

Relapsing polychondritis (_Rheum Dis Clin NA_ 2013;39:263)

•Inflammatory destruction of cartilaginous structures; onset usually age 40–60 y, ♂ = ♀

•Subacute onset of **red**, **painful**, and **swollen cartilage;** ultimately atrophic & deformed

•Common 臨床表現: bilateral auricular chondritis; nonerosive inflammatory arthritis; nasal chondritis; ocular inflammation; laryngeal or tracheal chondritis; cochlear and/or vestibular dysfxn

•40% of cases a/w immunologic disorder (eg, RA, SLE, vasc., Sjögren’s), cancer or MDS

•臨床diagnosis based on exam with multiple sites of cartilaginous inflammation

•Labs: ↑ ESR & CRP, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, anemia of chronic inflammation

•Bx (not req for dx): proteoglycan depletion, perichondrial inflammation and replacement with granulation tissue and fibrosis; immunofluorescence with Ig and C3 deposits

•Screen for pulm (肺功能, CXR/CT, ± bronch) and cardiac (ECG, TTE) involvement

•Therapy guided by disease activity and severity: **steroids** 1st line; NSAIDs, dapsone for sx control of arthralgias and mild disease; MTX, AZA, or biologics for steroid-sparing; cyclophosphamide for organ-threatening disease
