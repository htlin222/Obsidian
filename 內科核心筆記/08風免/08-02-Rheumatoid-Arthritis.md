## 定義 & 流行病學 (_Lancet_ 2016;388:2023)
• Chronic, symmetric, debilitating, and destructive inflammatory polyarthritis characterized by proliferative synovial tissue (pannus) formation in affected joints

• Pathogenesis involves over-production of TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 (∴ used as drug targets)

• Risk stems from combination of genetic (~50% of risk), environmental influences (eg, smoking, silica dust), and Pt factors (periodontal disease, Δs in gut microbiome)

• HLA-DRB1 haplotype a/w disease suscept., severity, & response to Rx (JAMA 2015;31


• Prevalence = 1% adults and 5% of ♀ >70 y; ♀ to ♂ ratio = 3:1; peak incidence 50–75 y

## 臨床表現 (_Medicine_ 2010;38:167)
• Usually insidious onset **pain**, **swelling**, & impaired function of joints with prolonged **morning stiffness** for ≥6 wk (typically PIPs, MCPs, wrists, knees, ankles, MTPs, cervical spine)

• Typically polyarticular (60% small joints, 30% large joints, 10% both), may be monoarticular (knee, shoulder, wrist) early in course; rheumatoid joints more susceptible to infection

• Joint deformities: **ulnar deviation**, **swan neck** (MCP flexion, PIP hyperextension, DIP flexion), **boutonnière** (PIP flexion, DIP hyperextension), **cock-up deformities** (toes)

• **C1–C2 instability** → myelopathy, ∴✔ C-spine flex/ext films prior to elective intubation

• Constitutional symptoms: _low-grade_ fever, weight loss, malaise

• **Extra-articular 表現** (18–41% of 病人) can occur at any time; ↑ frequency in seropositive (⊕ RF or anti-CCP) and with active disease (_Autoimmun Rev_ 2011;11:123)

## Laboratory & radiologic studies (_JAMA_ 2018;320:1360)

• **RF** (IgM/IgA/IgG anti-IgGAb) ⊕ in ~70% of 病人 with RA; also seen in other rheumatic diseases (SLE, Sjögren’s), infection (SBE, hepatitis, TB), cryo, ~5% of healthy population

• **Anti-CCP** (Ab to cyclic citrullinated peptide): ⊕ in ~80% of 病人 with RA, similar Se (~70%), but more Sp (>90%) than RF particularly for early RA (_Arth Rheum_ 2009;61:1472); a/w increased joint damage and low remission rates

• ~20% are seronegative (RF _and_ anti-CCP negative)

• ↑ ESR/CRP but 正常 in ~30%; ⊕ ANA in ~40%; ↑ globulin during periods of active disease

• Radiographs of hands and wrists: periarticular osteopenia, bone erosions, joint subluxation

• Increasing use of MSK U/S to diagnosis synovitis and erosive disease

## ACR/EULAR classification criteria (_Arth Rheum_ 2010;62:2569)
• Used in 臨床research, but not in 臨床practice

• Relevant for 病人 with ≥1 joint with synovitis not better explained by another disease

• Likelihood of RA ↑ with higher # (espec. ≥4) of small joints involved, ⊕ RF or anti-CCP (espec. high titer), ANA, ↑ ESR or CRP, and duration ≥6 wk

## Management (_Lancet_ 2017;389:2328 & 2338; _JAMA_ 2018;320:1360)
• Early dx and Rx (esp DMARD) with frequent follow-up and escalation of Rx as needed with **goal to achieve 臨床remission** or low disease activity

• ↓ time to remission ≈ ↑ length of sustained remission (_Arthritis Res Ther_ 2010;12:R97)

• Sero-⊕ disease (eg, RF or anti-CCP) a/w aggressive joint disease & EAM

• At dx, start _both_ rapid-acting agent (to acutely ↓ inflammation) and **D**isease**-M**odifying **A**nti**-R**heumatic **D**rug **(DMARD)** (typically take 1–3 mo to have max effect)

• _Rapid-acting drugs:_

> **NSAIDs** or COX-2 inhibitors: ↑ CV risk, GI adverse events, AKI; consider starting with PPI

> **glucocorticoids**: low dose (<20 mg/d oral) or joint injection

> NSAIDs + glucocorticoids: ↑↑ GI events; give PPI and minimize long-term concurrent use

• _DMARDs (see RA therapeutics below):_

> **Methotrexate** (1st line unless CKD, hepatitis, EtOH or lung disease), alternatives include sulfasalazine or leflunomide; consider HCQ if seronegative and mild disease

If inadequate response after 3 mo (despite DMARD dose escalation) consider:

> **combination Rx** with other DMARDs (eg, “triple therapy” with MTX, SAS and HCQ) _or_

> **adding biologic** (anti-TNF typically 1st line unless contraindication)

> MTX/SAS/HCQ non-inferior to etanercept/MTX (_NEJM_ 2013;369:307)

> JAK inhib: if fail biologics vs. initial DMARD (_NEJM_ 2017;376:652; _Lancet_ 2018;391:2503 & 2513)

• Given ↑ 排除 early CV morbidity/mortality, try to ↓ risk with lifestyle mgmt, lipid & DM screening
