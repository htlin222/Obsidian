原因 & DIAGNOSIS OF INFECTIOUS ARTHRITIS

原因 (_Curr Rheumatol Rep_ 2013;15:332)

•**Bacterial** (nongonococcal): early diagnosis and 治療 essential

•**Gonococcal** (_N. gonorrhea_): consider in sexually active young adults

•Viral: parvovirus, HCV, HBV, acute HIV, Chikungunya; mainly polyarticular, may mimic RA

•Mycobacterial: monoarticular or axial (Pott’s disease)

•Fungal: _Candida_ (esp. prosthetic joints), coccidiomycosis (valley fever), histoplasmosis

•Other: Lyme, _Mycoplasma_, _Salmonella_ (2° to anti-TNF Rx), Brucellosis, _T. whipplei_

Diagnosis (_JAMA_ 2007;297:1478)

•H&P with poor sensitivity and specificity for septic arthritis

•**Arthrocentesis in acute onset inflammatory monoarthritis** to 排除 septic arthritis; if possible obtain fluid sample prior to starting antibiotics

•Do not tap through overlying infected area to prevent introducing infxn into joint space

•✔ Fluid cell count with diff, Gram stain, bacterial culture, crystal analysis; **WBC** >**50k**

### with PMN predominance suspicious for bact. infxn; _crystals do not 排除 septic arthritis!_

BACTERIAL (NONGONOCOCCAL) ARTHRITIS

流行病學 & risk factors

•**Immunocompromised host:** DM, EtOH use, HIV, age >80, SLE, cancer, steroid use, etc.

•**Damaged joints:** RA, OA, gout, trauma, prior surgery/prosthetic, prior arthrocentesis (rare)

•**Bacterial seeding:** bacteremia especially secondary to IVDU or endocarditis; direct inoculation or spread from contiguous focus (eg, cellulitis, septic bursitis, osteo)

臨床表現 (_JAMA_ 2007;297:1478; _Lancet_ 2010;375:846)

•Acute onset **monoarticular arthritis** (>80%) with pain (Se 85%), swelling (Se 78%), warmth

•Location: **knee** (most common), hip, wrist, shoulder, ankle. In IVDU, tends to involve other areas including axial joints (eg, SI, symphysis pubis, sternoclavicular, manubrial joints).

•**Constit. sx:** fevers (Se 57%), rigors (Se 19%), sweats (Se 27%), malaise, myalgias, pain

•Infection can track from initial site to form fistulae, abscesses, or osteomyelitis

•_Septic bursitis must be differentiated from septic intra-articular effusion_

Additional diagnostic studies (_JAMA_ 2007;297:1478)

•Synovial fluid: **WBC usually** >**50k** (Se 62%, Sp 92%) but can be <10k, >**90% polys;** Gram stain ⊕ in ~75% of _Staph_, ~50% of GNR; Cx ⊕ in >90%; synovial bx most sens.

•**Leukocytosis** (Se 90%, Sp 36%); **elevated ESR/CRP** (Se >90%)

•**Blood cultures** ⊕ in >50% of cases, ~80% when more than 1 joint involved

•X-rays of joints should be obtained but usually normal until after ~2 wk of infection when may see bony erosions, joint space narrowing, osteomyelitis, and periostitis

•**CT & MRI** useful esp. for suspected hip infection or epidural abscess

治療 for native joints (_Curr Rheumatol Rep_ 2013;15:332)

•Prompt empiric antibiotics guided by Gram stain after surgical drainage. If Gram stain ⊖, empiric Rx with vancomycin; add anti-pseudomonal agent if elderly, immunocompromised.

* Can later Δ to antistaphylococcal penicillin or cefazolin based on sensitivities

•**IV antibiotics** × ≥2 wk followed by oral antibiotics; varies by 臨床course & microbiology

•Joint must be **drained**, often serially; arthroscopic drainage for larger joints and as initial 治療 but may also be accomplished by arthrocentesis. Serial synovial fluid analyses should demonstrate ↓ in WBC and sterility.

•10–15% mortality (up to 50% with polyarticular); depends on virulence, time to Rx, host

Prosthetic joint infections (_Infect Dis Clin North Am_ 2012;26:29; _CID_ 2013;56:e1)

•↑ risk in first 2 y s/p procedure; rate generally low (0.5–2.4%); risk factors include obesity, RA, immunocompromised state, steroids, & superficial surgical site infxn

•Staphylococci (coag negative & _S. aureus_) in >50%; polymicrobial in 10–20%

•Early (<3 mo s/p surgery) or delayed (3–24 mo) onset typically acquired during implantation; early with virulent organisms (eg, MRSA) and delayed with less virulent organisms (eg, _P. acnes_, coag negative _Staph_) & more indolent presentation

•Late (>24 mo) onset typically related to secondary hematogenous seeding

•Diagnosis requires arthrocentesis by orthopedics; ESR & CRP (CRP Se 73–91%, Sp 81– 86%; _NEJM_ 2009;361:787) can be helpful

•治療 typically requires prolonged 抗生素 & 2-stage joint replacement (joint retention a/w ~40% failure rate; _CID_ 2013;56:182) or life-long suppressive 抗生素. _ID and orthopedics consultation required._

DISSEMINATED GONOCOCCAL INFECTION (DGI)

流行病學 (_Infect Dis Clin North Am_ 2005;19:853)

•_N. gonorrhea;_ most frequent type of infectious arthritis in sexually active young adults

•**Normal host** as well as 病人 with deficiencies of terminal components of complement

•♀:♂ = 4:1; ↑ incidence during menses, pregnancy, & postpartum period, SLE; ↑ incidence in homosexual males; rare after age 40 y

臨床表現

•Preceded by **mucosal infection** (eg, cervix, urethra, anus, or pharynx) that is often asx

•Two distinct syndromes, although 病人 can have both:

**Joint localized:** purulent arthritis (40%), usually 1–2 joints (knees > wrists > ankles)

**DGI:** triad of polyarthralgias, tenosynovitis, skin lesions

1) _polyarthralgias_: migratory joint pain, can affect small or large joints

2) _tenosynovitis_: pain/inflammation of tendon and its sheath in wrists, fingers, ankles, toes

3) _skin lesions_: gunmetal gray pustules with erythematous base on extremities & trunk

•Rare complications: Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (perihepatitis), pericarditis, meningitis, myocarditis, osteomyelitis from direct extension of joint-localized infection

Additional diagnostic studies

•Synovial fluid: **WBC** >**50k** (but can be <10k), **poly predominant**

Gram stain ⊕ in ~25%; culture ⊕ in up to 50% if done with Thayer-Martin media

•Blood culture: more likely ⊕ in DGI; rarely in joint localized disease

•Gram stain and culture of skin lesions occasionally ⊕

•Cervical, urethral, pharyngeal, rectal PCR or cx on Thayer-Martin media; ✔ _Chlamydia_

治療

•**Ceftriaxone × 7–14 d with empiric azithromycin 1g x 1 dose** for _Chlamydia_ (fluoroquinolones no longer recommended due to resistance)

•Joint arthroscopy/lavage may be required for purulent arthritis; rarely >1 time

OLECRANON & PREPATELLAR BURSITIS

流行病學 & risk factors (_Infect Dis North Am_ 2005;19:991)

•>150 bursae in the body; 2 most commonly infected are **olecranon** and **prepatellar**

•Most commonly (esp. superficial bursae) due to direct trauma, percutaneous inoculation, or contiguous spread from adjacent infection (eg, cellulitis)

•Other risk factors: recurrent noninfectious inflammation (eg, gout, RA, CPPD), diabetes

•_S. aureus_ (80%) most common, followed by streptococci

Diagnosis

•Physical exam: discrete bursal swelling, erythema, maximal tenderness at center of bursa with preserved joint range of motion

•Aspirate bursa if concern for infxn, ✔ cell count, Gram stain, bacterial cx, crystals

### WBC >**20k with poly predominance** suspicious for bacterial infection, but lower counts common (crystals do _not_ rule out septic bursitis!)

•Assess for adjacent joint effusion, which can also be septic

•Do not tap through infected skin to avoid introducing infxn into bursa

Initial therapy

•Prompt empiric coverage for staphylococci and streptococci: PO 抗生素 acceptable for mild presentation; **vancomycin** if ill appearing; broaden spectrum based on risk factors

•Modify antibiotics based on Gram stain, culture results, & 臨床course. Duration of Rx is 1–4 wks. **Serial aspirations** every 1–3 d until sterile or no reaccumulation of fluid.

•Surgery if unable to drain bursa through aspiration, evidence of foreign body or necrosis, recurrent/refractory bursitis with concern for infxn of adjacent structures
