# ADRENAL DISORDERS

CUSHING’S SYNDROME (HYPERCORTISOLISM) (_NEJM_ 2017;376:1451)

_Cushing’s syndrome_ = _cortisol excess_  
_Cushing’s disease_ = _Cushing’s syndrome 2° to pituitary ACTH hypersecretion_

原因 of hypercortisolism

• Most commonly iatrogenic caused by exogenous glucocorticoids (though underreported)

• **Cushing’s disease** (60–70%): ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (usually microadenoma) or hyperplasia

• **Adrenal tumor** (15–25%): adenoma or (rarely) carcinoma

• **Ectopic ACTH** (5–10%): SCLC, carcinoid, islet cell tumors, medullary thyroid cancer, pheo

臨床表現 (_Lancet_ 2006;367:13)

• _Nonspecific:_ glucose intolerance or DM, HTN, obesity, oligo- or amenorrhea, osteoporosis

• _More specific:_ central obesity with extremity wasting, dorsocervical fat pads, spont. bruising

• _Most specific:_ proximal myopathy, rounded facies, facial plethora, wide purple striae

• Other: depression, insomnia, psychosis, impaired cognition, hypokalemia, acne, hirsutism, hyperpigmentation (if ↑ ACTH), fungal skin infxns, nephrolithiasis, polyuria

### Diagnosis

• Typically performed in _outPt_ setting

• _Very difficult as inPt b/c hypercortisolism from acute illness and hosp._

CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; DST, dexamethasone suppression test; UFC, urinary free cortisol

Overnight 1 mg DST = give 1 mg at 11 p.m.; ✔ 8 a.m. serum cortisol (suppression if <1.8 μg/dL); <5% false ⊕ (primarily used to evaluate sub臨床Cushing’s in adrenal “incidentalomas”)

11 p.m. salivary cortisol = 異常 if level ↑; 24-h UFC = 異常 if level ↑, > 4× ULN virtually diagnostic

48-h LD DST + CRH = 0.5 mg q6h × 2 d, then IV CRH 2 h later; ✔ serum cortisol 15 min later (⊕ = >1.4 μg/dL)

48-h LD DST = 0.5 mg q6h × 2 d; ✔ 24-h UFC at base. & during last 24 h of dex (suppress if <10% of base)

48-h HD DST = 2 mg q6h × 2 d; ✔ 24-h UFC as per LD DST

O/N HD DST = 8 mg at 11 p.m.; ✔ 9 a.m. serum cortisol (suppression if <32% of baseline)

CRH test = 1 μg/kg IV; ✔ cortisol and ACTH (⊕ stim if > 35% ↑ in ACTH or >20% ↑ in cortisol above baseline)

BIPSS, bilat. Inferior petrosal sinus vein sampling; ✔ petrosal:pewwripheral ACTH ratio (⊕ = 2 basal, >3 after CRH)

治療 of Cushing’s syndrome (_JCEM_ 2015;100:2807)

• **Surgical:** resection of pituitary adenoma, adrenal tumor or ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor, or bilat surgical adrenalectomy if unable to control source of ACTH

• **Medical:** cabergoline, pasireotide, mitotane, ketoconazole, or metyrapone to ↓ cortisol, and/or mifepristone to block cortisol action at glucocorticoid receptor; frequently used as bridge to surgery or when surgery contraindicated

• **Radiation:** can do pituitary XRT, but not effective immediately (takes 6 mo to 2 y)

• Glucocorticoid replacement therapy × 6–36 mo after TSS (lifelong glucocorticoid + mineralocorticoid replacement if medical or surgical adrenalectomy)

HYPERALDOSTERONISM

原因

• **Primary** (adrenal disorders, renin-independent increase in aldosterone; _JCEM_ 2015;100:1) adrenal hyperplasia (60–70%), adenoma (**Conn’s syndrome**, 30–40%), carcinoma glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA; ACTH-dep. rearranged promoter)

• **Secondary** (extra-adrenal disorders, ↑ aldosterone is renin-dependent)

Primary reninism: renin-secreting tumor (rare)

Secondary reninism: renovascular disease: RAS, malignant hypertension; edematous states with ↓ effective arterial volume: CHF, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome;

hypovolemia, diuretics, T2D, Bartter’s (defective Na/K/2Cl transporter ≈ receiving loop diuretic), Gitelman’s (defective renal Na/Cl transporter ≈ receiving thiazide diuretic)

• **Nonaldosterone mineralocorticoid excess** mimics hyperaldosteronism

11β-HSD defic. (→ lack of inactivation of cortisol, which binds to mineralocorticoid recept.)

Black licorice (glycyrrhizic acid inhibits 11β-HSD), extreme hypercortisolism (overwhelming 11β-HSD), exogenous mineralocorticoids

Liddle’s syndrome (constitutively activated/overexpressed distal tubular renal Na channel)

臨床表現

• **Mild-to-moderate HTN** (11% of 病人 with HTN refractory to 3 drugs; _Lancet_ 2008;371:1921) headache, muscle weakness, polyuria, polydipsia; no peripheral edema because of “escape” from Na retention; malignant HTN is rare

• Classically **hypokalemia** (but often normal), metabolic alkalosis, mild hypernatremia

Diagnostic studies (_JCEM_ 2008;93:3266; _SCNA_ 2014;94:643)

• 5–10% of 病人 with HTN; ∴ screen if HTN + hypoK, adrenal mass, refractory/early onset HTN

• Screening: **aldo** (>15–20 ng/dL) _and_ **plasma aldo:renin ratio** (>20 if 1°) obtain 8 a.m. paired values (_off_ spironolactone & eplerenone for 6 wk); Se & Sp >85%

• ACEI/ARB, diuretics, CCB can ↑ renin activity → ↓ PAC/PRA ratio and βBs may ↑ PAC/PRA ratio;∴ avoid. α-blockers generally best to control HTN during dx testing.

• Confirm with **sodium suppression test** (fail to suppress aldo after sodium load) oral salt load (+ KCl) × 3 d, ✔ 24-h urine (⊕ if urinary aldo >12 µg/d while urinary Na >200 mEq/d) _or_ 2L NS over 4 h, measure plasma aldo at end of infusion (⊕ if aldo >5 ng/dL)

### Figure 7-4 Approach to suspected hyperaldosteronism

![](https://i.imgur.com/a8FdjDN.jpg)

治療 (_Surg Clin N Am_ 2014;94:643)

• Adenoma → adrenalectomy vs. medical Rx with spironolactone or eplerenone

• Hyperplasia → spironolactone or eplerenone; GRA → glucocorticoids ± spironolactone

• Carcinoma → adrenalectomy

ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

原因

• **Primary** = adrenocortical disease = **_Addison’s disease_**

**autoimmune:** isolated or in assoc with APS (see table on [page 7-2](text/part0012_split_000.html#page_7-2))

**infection:** TB, CMV, histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis

**vascular:** hemorrhage (usually in setting of sepsis), adrenal vein thrombosis, HIT, trauma

**metastatic disease:** (90% of adrenals must be destroyed to cause insufficiency)

**deposition diseases:** hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis

**drugs:** azole antifungals, etomidate (even after single dose), rifampin, anticonvulsants

• **Secondary** = pituitary failure of ACTH secretion (but aldosterone **intact** b/c RAA axis) any cause of primary or secondary hypopituitarism (see “Pituitary Disorders”)

glucocorticoid therapy (can occur after ≤2 wk of “suppressive doses”; dose effect variable; even <10 mg of prednisone daily chronically can be suppressive)

megestrol (a progestin with some glucocorticoid activity)

臨床表現 (_Lancet_ 2014;383:2152)

• **Primary** or **secondary: weakness and fatigability** (99%), **anorexia** (99%), **orthostatic hypotension** (90%), nausea (86%), vomiting (75%), hyponatremia (88%)

• **Primary only** (extra signs and symptoms due to lack of aldosterone and ↑ ACTH): marked **orthostatic hypotension** (because volume depleted), salt craving, **hyperpigmentation** (seen in creases, mucous membranes, pressure areas, nipples), **hyperkalemia**

• **Secondary only:** ± other 表現 of hypopituitarism (see “Pituitary Disorders”)

Diagnostic studies (_JCEM_ 2016;101:364)

• Early a.m. serum cortisol: <3 µg/dL virtually diagnostic; ≥18 µg/dL generally consistent with intact adrenal function (see Appendix for examples of test results)

• Standard (250 µg) **cosyntropin stimulation test** (testing ability of ACTH → ↑ cortisol)

normal = 60-min (or 30-min) post-ACTH cortisol ≥18 µg/dL

abnormal in _primary_ b/c adrenal gland diseased and unable to give adequate output

abnormal in _chronic_ secondary b/c adrenals atrophied and unable to respond

(very rarely, may be _normal_ in _acute pituitary injury_ b/c adrenals still able to respond → use early a.m. cortisol instead)

All glucocorticoids (incl creams, inh. & drops) affect test. Must know exposure to interpret.

• Other tests (w/ guidance by endocrinologist): renin, aldosterone, insulin-induced hypoglycemia (measure serum cortisol response); metyrapone (blocks cortisol synthesis and therefore stimulates ACTH, measure plasma 11-deoxycortisol and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels)

• Other lab abnormalities: hypoglycemia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis, ± neutropenia

• ACTH: ↑ in 1°, ↓ or low-normal in 2°

• Imaging studies to consider

pituitary MRI to detect anatomical abnormalities

adrenal CT: small, noncalcified adrenals in autoimmune, enlarged in metastatic disease, hemorrhage, infection or deposition (although they may be normal-appearing)

治療

• _Acute_ insufficiency: volume resusc. with normal saline + **hydrocortisone IV** (see below)

• _Chronic_ insufficiency: (1) prednisone ~4–5 mg PO qam or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg PO qd (⅔ a.m., ⅓ early p.m.); (2) fludrocortisone (_not_ needed in 2° adrenal insufficiency) 0.05–0.2 mg PO qam (_JCEM_ 2018;103:376); (3) backup dexamethasone 4-mg IM prefilled syringe given to Pt for emergency situations

Adrenal insufficiency & critical illness (_NEJM_ 2003;348:727; _JAMA_ 2009;301:2362)

• Low cortisol binding proteins; ∴ dx of adrenal insufficiency problematic (_NEJM_ 2013;368:1477)

• Adrenal insufficiency rare in most cases of shock unless adrenal infarction or bleed, Waterhouse-Friderichson, CNS or pituitary bleed

• Reasonable to perform ACTH stim as soon as possible in HoTN Pt with suspicion for adrenal insufficiency

• Can consider above dx criteria, but decision for Rx should also be based on 臨床assessment due to risk of false ⊖ and ⊕ results in context of altered physiology

• If concerned, initiate corticosteroids early: use hydrocortisone 50–100 mg IV q8h; prior to ACTH stim test, use dexamethasone 2–4 mg IV q6h + fludrocortisone 50 µg daily

• Controversial data for empiric steroids in all critically ill 病人 (see “Sepsis”)

### Adrenal crisis in adrenal insufficiency (_Lancet Diabetes & Endo_ 2015;3:216)

• Precipitants: bilateral adrenal hemorrhage or infarction, pituitary infarction, pre-existing adrenal insufficiency + serious infection or GI illness

• Presentation: shock + anorexia, N/V, abd pain, weakness, fatigue, confusion, coma, fever

• Lab findings: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (1°)

• Rx: hydrocortisone 50–100 mg IV q8 + IVF; do not delay for dx tests

PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA & PARAGANGLIOMA

臨床表現 (five Ps) (_Lancet_ 2005;366:665)

• Neuroendocrine neoplasm leads to inappropriate and paroxysmal release of adrenergic agents including epinephrine, norephinephrine, and rarely dopamine

• **Pressure** (hypertension, paroxysmal in 50%, severe & resistant to Rx, occ orthostatic)

• **Pain** (headache, chest pain)

• **Palpitations** (tachycardia, tremor, wt loss, fever)

• **Perspiration** (profuse)

• **Pallor** (vasoconstrictive spell)

• Paroxysms can be triggered by meds (eg, β-blockers) abdominal manipulation

• Associated with MEN2A/2B, von Hippel Lindau, NF1, familial paraganglioma (mutations in succinate dehydrogenase gene B, C and D) or _TMEM127_ mutations

• Up to 40% of pheos/paragangliomas thought to have underlying genetic etiology; genetic testing frequently recommended

Diagnostic studies (_JCEM_ 2014;99:1915)

• 24° urinary fractionated metanephrines: 85–97% Se, 69–95% Sp. Screening test of choice if low-risk (b/c false ⊕ with severe illness, renal failure, OSA, labetalol due to assay interference, acetaminophen, TCAs, medications containing sympathomimetics).

• Plasma-free metanephrines: 89–100% Se, 79–97% Sp (_JAMA_ 2002;287:1427). Screening test of choice if high risk, but ↑ rate of false ⊕ in low-prevalence population. False ⊕ rate lower if patient supine for 30 min (estimated 2.8× ↑ false ⊕ if seated).

• Adrenal CT generally better than MRI; PET for known metastatic disease or to localize nonadrenal mass but usually easy to find; consider MIBG scintigraphy if CT/MRI ⊖

• Consider genetic testing if bilateral disease, young Pt, ⊕ FHx, extra-adrenal

治療

• α-blockade first (usually phenoxybenzamine) ± β-blockade (often propranolol) → surgery

• Preoperative volume expansion is critical due to possible hypotension after tumor excision

ADRENAL INCIDENTALOMAS

流行病學

• 4% of 病人 undergoing abdominal CT scan have incidentally discovered adrenal mass; prevalence ↑ with age

Differential diagnosis

• **Nonfunctioning mass:** adenoma, cysts, abscesses, granuloma, hemorrhage, lipoma,

myelolipoma, primary or metastatic malignancy

• **Functioning mass:** pheochromocytoma, adenoma (cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones), nonclassical CAH, other endocrine tumor, carcinoma

Hormonal workup (_NEJM_ 2007;356:601; _EJE_ 2016;175:G1)

• **Rule out sub臨床Cushing’s syndrome** _in all 病人_ using 1 mg overnight DST (Sp 91%). Abnormal results require confirmatory testing.

• **Rule out hyperaldosteronism** _if hypertensive_ with plasma aldo & renin (see above)

• **Rule out pheochromocytoma** _in ALL 病人_ (b/c of morbidity unRx’d pheo) using 24-h urine fractionated metanephrines or plasma-free metanephrines

Malignancy workup

• CT and MRI characteristics may suggest adenoma vs. carcinoma

_Benign features:_ unenhanced CT <10 Hounsfield units or CT contrast-medium washout >50% at 10 min; size <4 cm; smooth margins, homogenous and hypodense appearance; can follow such incidentalomas with periodic scans

_Suspicious features:_ size >6 cm or ↑ size on repeat scan; irregular margins, heterogeneous, dense or vascular appearance; h/o malignancy or young age. Such incidentalomas warrant resection or repeat scan at short interval.

• Rule out metastatic cancer (and infection) in 病人 with h/o cancer; ~50% of adrenal incidentalomas are malignant

Follow-up

• If hormonal workup ⊖ and appearance benign, yearly fxnal testing for 4 y with follow-up imaging at 6, 12, & 24 mo reasonable approach, but controversial
