HYPOTHYROIDISM

原因

• Primary (>90% of cases of hypothyroidism; ↓ **free T****4**, ↑ TSH)

Goitrous: **Hashimoto’s thyroiditis** (after hyperthyroid phase of thyroiditis), iodine deficiency, lithium, amiodarone

Nongoitrous: surgical destruction, s/p radioactive iodine or XRT, amiodarone

• Secondary (central): ↓ free T4; TSH low, inappropriately 正常, or slightly high (although functionally inactive due to abnormal glycosylation); due to hypothalamic or pituitary failure

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis

• Autoimmune destruction with patchy lymphocytic infiltration

• Associated with other autoimmune disease and may be part of APS Type II

• ⊕ antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) Abs in >90%

臨床表現 (_Annals_ 2009;151:ITC61)

• **Early:** weakness, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, depression, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, menorrhagia, dry skin, coarse brittle hair, brittle nails, carpal tunnel syndrome, delayed DTRs (“hung up” reflexes), diastolic HTN, hyperlipidemia

• **Late:** slow speech, hoarseness, loss of outer third of eyebrows, **myxedema** (nonpitting skin thickening due to ↑ glycosaminoglycans), periorbital puffiness, bradycardia, pleural, pericardial, & peritoneal effusions, atherosclerosis

• **Myxedema crisis:** hypothermia, hypotension, hypoventilation, Δ MS (including coma) hyponatremia, hypoglycemia; often precipitated by infection or major cardiopulmonary or neurologic illness (_Med Clin North Am_ 2012;96:385)

Diagnostic studies (_Lancet_ 2017;390:1550)

• ↓ **free T4;** ↑ **TSH** in 1º hypothyroidism; ⊕ antithyroid Ab (TPO) in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis

• May see hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, anemia, ↑ LDL, ↓ HDL and ↑ CK

• Screening recommended for pregnant women

治療 of overt hypothyroidism

• Levothyroxine (1.5–1.7 µg/kg/d), re ✔ TSH q5–6wk & titrate until euthyroid (can take mos)

• _Lower starting dose_ (0.3–0.5 µg/kg/d) if at risk for ischemic heart disease or elderly

• ↑ dose typically needed if:

poor GI absorption: meds that ↓ absorption (iron, calcium, cholestyramine, sucralfate, PPI), celiac disease, IBD

meds that accelerate T4 catabolism (eg, phenytoin, phenobarbital)

initiation of estrogen replacement; pregnancy (~30% ↑ by wk 8): TSH goals change by trimester: 1st = 0.1–4.0 mIU/L, 2nd & 3rd = gradual return of TSH to nonpregnant 正常 range (_Thyroid_ 2017;3:315)

Sub臨床hypothyroidism (_NEJM_ 2017;376:2556; _JAMA_ 2019;322:153)

• Mild ↑ TSH and **normal free T****4** with only subtle or no sx

• If TSH <7 or ⊖ anti-TPO Ab, ~¹∕² resolve after 2 y (_JCEM_ 2012;97:1962) if ↑ titers of antithyroid Abs, progression to overt hypothyroidism is ~4%/y

• No clear benefit to Rx (_NEJM_ 2017;376:2534). In practice, follow expectantly or Rx to improve mild sx or dyslipidemia. Experts often Rx if TSH >10 mU/L, goiter, pregnancy or infertility.

### Myxedema coma (ie, profound hypothyroidism; _Med Clin North Am_ 2012;96:385**)**

• Presentation: hypothermia, hypotension, hypoventilation, Δ MS (coma rare), hyponatremia, hypoglycemia; often precipitated by infxn or major cardiopulmonary or neurologic illness

• 治療: supportive care most important. Slow metabolism of drugs can lead to coma. Correction of hypothyroidism takes time. Load 5–8 µg/kg T4 IV, then 50–100 µg IV qd; b/c peripheral conversion impaired, may also give 5–10 µg T3 IV q8h if unstable with bradycardia and/or hypothermia (T3 more arrhythmogenic); must give **empiric _adrenal replacement therapy_** first as ↓ adrenal reserves in myxedema coma.

HYPERTHYROIDISM

原因 (_Lancet_ 2016;388:906)

• **Graves’ disease** (60–80% of thyrotoxicosis)

• **Thyroiditis:** thyrotoxic phase of subacute (granulomatous) or painless (lymphocytic)

• **Toxic adenomas** (single or multinodular goiter)

• Extremely rare: TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or pituitary resistant to thyroid hormone (↑ TSH, ↑ free T4)

• Misc: amiodarone, iodine-induced, thyrotoxicosis factitia, struma ovarii (3% of ovarian dermoid tumors and teratomas), hCG-secreting tumors (eg, choriocarcinoma), large deposits of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer

臨床表現

• Restlessness, sweating, tremor, moist warm skin, fine hair, tachycardia, AF, weight loss, ↑ frequency of stools, menstrual irregularities, hyperreflexia, osteoporosis, stare and lid lag (due to sympathetic overactivity)

• **Apathetic thyrotoxicosis:** seen in elderly who can present with lethargy as only sx

Laboratory testing

• ↑ **free T****4** and **total T****3****;** ↓ **TSH** (except in TSH-secreting tumors)

• **RAIU scan** is very useful study to differentiate causes (see table on [page 7-3](text/part0012_split_001.html#page_7-3)); cannot do if recent IV contrast or amio load b/c iodine blocks uptake, so ✔ autoantibodies instead

• Rarely need to ✔ for autoantibodies except in pregnancy (to assess risk of fetal Graves’)

• May see hypercalciuria ± hypercalcemia, ↑ Aϕ, anemia

### Figure 7-2 Workup of primary hyperthyroidism

![](https://i.imgur.com/BRtpH1u.jpg)

Graves’ disease (_NEJM_ 2016;375:1552)

• ♀:♂ ratio is 5–10:1, most 病人 between 40 and 60 y at dx

• ⊕ **thyroid antibodies:** TSI or TBII (⊕ in 80%), anti-TPO, antithyroglobulin; ANA

• 臨床表現 in addition to those of hyperthyroidism (see above):

**Goiter:** diffuse, nontender, with thyroid bruit

### Ophthalmopathy (_NEJM_ 2010;362:726): seen in 50%; up to 90% if formally tested. Periorbital edema, lid retraction, proptosis, conjunctivitis, diplopia (EOM infiltration); associated with smoking. Stare and lid lag seen in any type of hyperthyroidism.

### Pretibial myxedema (3%): infiltrative dermopathy

Thyroiditis (_NEJM_ 2003;348:2646; _Med Clin North Am_ 2012;96:223)

• **Acute:** bacterial infection (very rare in U.S. except postsurgical), typically _Staph/Strep_ spp.

• **Subacute:** transient thyrotoxicosis → transient hypothyroidism → normal thyroid fxn

### Painful (viral, granulomatous or de Quervain’s): fever, ↑ ESR; Rx = NSAIDs, ASA, steroids

### Silent (postpartum, autoimmune including Hashimoto’s, or lymphocytic): painless, ⊕ TPO Abs; if postpartum, can recur with subsequent pregnancies

**Other:** meds (amiodarone, lithium, TKIs), palpation thyroiditis, post-radiation

治療 (_Thyroid_ 2011;21:593)

• β-blockers: control tachycardia (propranolol also ↓ T4 → T3 conversion)

• Graves’ disease: either antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine (_JAMA_ 2015;314:2544)

**methimazole:** 70% chance of recurrence after 1 y; side effects include pruritus, rash, arthralgia, fever, N/V and _agranulocytosis_ in 0.5%. PTU: 2nd line (risk of hepatocellular necrosis; TID dosing; slower effect; _JCEM_ 2007;92:2157). For both, need to ✔ LFTs, WBC, TSH at baseline and in follow-up.

### radioactive iodine (RAI) (_NEJM_ 2011;364:542): typically done as outPt; preRx with antithyroid drugs in selected 病人 with CV disease or elderly to prevent ↑ thyrotoxicosis, stop 3 d before to allow RAI uptake; >75% of treated 病人 become hypothyroid

**surgery:** less commonly chosen for Graves’, usually for 病人 with obstructive goiter or ophthalmopathy

• Ophthalmopathy: can worsen after RAI; prophylax with prednisone in high-risk 病人; can be Rx’d with radiation and/or surgical decompression of orbits (_NEJM_ 2009;360:994)

• Toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter: RAI or surgery (methimazole preRx for surgery, in selected patients before RAI)

Sub臨床hyperthyroidism (_NEJM_ 2018;378:2411)

• Mild ↓ TSH and **normal free T****4** with only subtle or no sx

• ~15% → overt hyperthyroidism in 2 y; ↑ risk of AF, CHD, fracture (_JAMA_ 2015;313:2055)

• Rx controversial: consider if TSH <0.1 mU/L and ↑ risk for CV disease or osteopenic

### Thyroid storm (extremely rare in hyperthyroidism; _JCEM_ 2015;2:451)

• Presentation: delirium, fever, tachycardia, systolic HTN with wide pulse pressure and ↓ MAP, GI symptoms; 20–30% mortality

• Diagnosis: no universally accepted criteria. Biochemical hyperthyroidism + severe sx, consider additional dx that may explain/contribute to sx.

• 治療: β-blocker, PTU or methimazole, iopanoic acid or iodide (for Wolff-Chaikoff effect) >1 h after PTU, ± steroids (↓ T4 → T3)

NONTHYROIDAL ILLNESS (SICK EUTHYROID SYNDROME)  
(_J Endocrinol_ 2010;205:1)

• TFT abnormalities in 病人 with severe nonthyroidal illness (∴ in acute illness, ✔ TFTs only if ↑ concern for thyroid disease); _may_ have acquired transient central hypothyroidism

• If thyroid dysfxn suspected in critically ill Pt, TSH alone not reliable; must measure total T4, free T4, & T3

• Mild illness: ↓ T4 → T3 conversion, ↑ rT3 → ↓ T3; in severe illness: ↓ TBG & albumin, ↑↑ rT3 → ↓↓ T3, ↑ degradation of T4, central ↓ TSH → ↓↓ **T3**, ↓↓ **T4**, ↓ **free T4**, ↓ **TSH**

• Recovery phase: ↑ TSH followed by recovery of T4 and then T3

• Replacement thyroxine _not_ helpful or recommended for critically ill 病人 with ↓ T3 and T4 unless other signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism

AMIODARONE AND THYROID DISEASE

Overview (_JCEM_ 2010;95:2529)

• 6 mg iodine per 200-mg tablet; risk of thyroid dysfunction lower with lower doses

• ✔ TSH prior to therapy, at 4-mo intervals on amio, and for 1 y after if amio d/c’d

Hypothyroidism (occurs in ~10%; more common in iodine-replete areas)

• 病生理

(1) Wolff-Chaikoff effect: iodine load ↓ I– uptake, organification and release of T4 & T3

(2) inhibits T4 → T3 conversion

(3) ? direct/immune-mediated thyroid destruction

• Normal individuals: ↓ T4; then escape Wolff-Chaikoff effect and have ↑ T4, ↓ T3, ↑ TSH; then TSH normalizes (after 1–3 mo)

• Susceptible individuals (eg, sub臨床Hashimoto’s, ∴ ✔ anti-TPO) do _not_ escape effects

• 治療: thyroxine to normalize TSH; may need larger than usual dose

Hyperthyroidism (3% of 病人 on amio; ~10–20% of 病人 _in iodine-deficient areas_)

• Type 1 = underlying multinodular goiter or autonomous thyroid tissue

Jod-Basedow effect: iodine load → ↑ **synthesis** of T4 and T3 in autonomous tissue

• Type 2 = destructive thyroiditis

↑ **release** of preformed T4 & T3 → hyperthyroidism → hypothyroidism → recovery

• Doppler U/S: type 1 with ↑ thyroid blood flow; type 2 with ↓ flow

• 治療: not absolutely necessary to d/c amio b/c amio ↓ T4 → T3 conversion methimazole for type 1; steroids (eg, 40 mg prednisone qd) for type 2 often difficult to distinguish, so Rx for both typically initiated (_JCEM_ 2001;86:3) consider thyroidectomy in severely ill patient

THYROID CANCER (_NEJM_ 2015;373:2347; _Thyroid_ 2016;26:1)

Thyroid nodules (_JAMA_ 2018;319:914)

• Prevalence 5–10% (50–60% if screen with U/S), ♀ > ♂, ~7–15% malignant

• Screening U/S recommended if FHx of MEN2 or medullary thyroid cancer, personal h/o neck XRT, palpable nodules or multinodular goiter

• Features a/w ↑ risk of malig: age <20 or >70 y, ♂, h/o neck XRT, hard & immobile mass, cervical LAN, dysphonia

• U/S features a/w benign dx: cystic nodules, “spongiform” sonographic pattern

• Worrisome findings: hypoechoic, solid, irregular borders, microCa2+, height>width, >20 mm

• Indications for FNA: >10-mm nodule with suspicious features

### Papillary thyroid cancer

• Most common form (85% of differentiated thyroid cancers); peak incidence 30 to 50 y

• Risk factors: childhood radiation exposure, FHx in 1° relative, familial syndrome

• Low-risk, mort. 1–2% at 20 y; mets to neck LN common, but prognosis remains good

• Rx is surgery; after surgical resection, RAI if medium or high risk (_Lancet_ 2013;381:1046 & 1058)

### Follicular thyroid cancer

• Peak incidence 40 to 60 y, ♀:♂ 3:1; RFs: childhood radiation; FHx; familial syndrome

• Mortality 10–20% at 20 y; mets frequently distal due to hematogenous spread

• Hurthle cell carcinoma: pathologic dx; variant a/w poorer prognosis and ↑ recurrence rate

### Anaplastic thyroid cancer (_Endo Metab Clin North Am_ 2008;37:525)

• ♀:♂ 1.5–2:1; poorly differentiated, extremely aggressive, mortality 90% at 5 y

• 表現為 rapidly growing fixed & hard neck mass, regional or distant spread in 90% at dx

• Rx options include surgery, radiation, trach, chemo, investigational 臨床trials

### Medullary thyroid cancer

• Neuroendocrine tumor of C cells, peak incidence 40 to 60 y, a/w MEN2A and MEN2B

• Most commonly solitary nodule; calcitonin production and level used to trend dz progression, dx with FNA (Se 50–80%); mortality 25–50% at 5 y

• Surgery first-line 治療
