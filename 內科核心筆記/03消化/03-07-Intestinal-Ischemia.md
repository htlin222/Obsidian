# INTESTINAL ISCHEMIA

# ACUTE MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA

## 定義 and causes (_NEJM_ 2016;374:959)

• Reduced or absent blood flow to small intestine, typically caused by _arterial_ (ie, SMA or its branches) occlusion or transient hypoperfusion or less often by _venous_ occlusion

• **Arterial embolism** (~40–50%): embolic occlusion to SMA (has narrow take-off angle), often in setting of AF, valvular disease incl. endocarditis, atherosclerotic plaque in aorta

• **SMA thrombosis** (~20–30%): typically due to atherosclerosis at origin of SMA; other risk factors incl. vascular injury from abd trauma, infxn, or mesenteric dissections/aneurysms

• **Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia** (~10%): transient intestinal hypoperfusion due to ↓ CO, athero, sepsis, drugs that ↓ gut perfusion (pressors, cocaine, amphetamines)

• Mesenteric **venous thrombosis** (MVT, ~5%): a/w hypercoag. states, portal hypertension, IBD, malignancy, inflammation (pancreatitis, peritonitis), pregnancy, trauma, surgery

• **Focal segmental ischemia of small bowel** (<5%): vascular occlusion to small segments of small bowel (vasculitis, atheromatous emboli, strangulated hernias, XRT)

## 臨床表現

• Total arterial or venous occlusion: **sudden abd pain out of proportion to abdominal tenderness on exam**, progressing to frank infarction with peritoneal signs if untreated

• Nonocclusive: abd distention & pain, n/v, **lower GI bleeding** due to mucosal sloughing; often occurring after episode of hypoperfusion (eg, cardiac event or shock)

• Exam ranges: unremarkable ± abd distention to peritoneal (infarction); ⊕ **FOBT ~75%**

## Diagnostic studies

• Dx relies on high level of suspicion; rapid dx essential to avoid infarction (occurs within hrs)

• Mortality 20 to >70% if bowel infarcted; dx prior to infarction strongest predictor of survival

• Laboratory: often 正常; ~75% ↑ WBC; ↑ amylase, LDH, PO4, D-dimer; ~50% ↑ lactate (late)

• KUB: 正常 early before infarct; “thumbprinting,” ileus, pneumatosis in later stages

• **CT angiography** (arterial phase): noninvasive test of choice; _venous_ phase for dx MVT

• **Angiography:** gold standard; potentially therapeutic; indicated if vasc occlusion suspected

 ## 治療 (_NEJM_ 2016;374:959; _World J Emerg Surg_ 2017;12:38)

• IVF, NPO, **optimize hemodynamics** (minimize pressors), **broad-spectrum 抗生素**, **anti-coagulation** with heparin ± **tPA** (for occlusive disease), **IV papaverine** (vasodilator; for non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia)

• If evidence of peritonitis: to OR for surgical endovascular therapies & bowel resection

• **SMA thrombosis:** percutaneous (stenting) or surgical revascularization

• **SMA embolism:** embolectomy (catheter-based aspiration vs. surgical)

• **Nonocclusive:** correct underlying cause (esp. cardiac)

• **Mesenteric venous thrombosis:** 3–6 mo warfarin after initial heparinization. Fibrinolysis or thrombectomy typically reserved for 病人 with hemodynamic instability or refractory sx.

• **Focal segmental ischemia:** typically surgical resection

# CHRONIC MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA

• 定義 and causes: ↓ blood flow to gut typically because of mesenteric atherosclerosis

• Sx: “intestinal angina” = **postprandial abd pain**, early satiety, & ↓ wt due to fear of eating. If pain becomes constant → could represent acute thrombosis (see above).

• Dx: duplex U/S or CTA; angiography gold std; gastric tonometry exercise testing

• 治療: surgical revascularization (1st line); could also consider angioplasty ± stenting

# ISCHEMIC COLITIS

## 定義 & 病生理

• Nonocclusive disease 2° to Δs in systemic circulation or anatomic/fxnal Δs in local mesenteric vasculature; often underlying etiology unknown, frequently seen in elderly

• “Watershed” areas (splenic flexure & rectosigmoid) most susceptible; 25% involve R side; confers worse prognosis (_Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol_ 2015;13:1969)

## 臨床表現, diagnosis, & 治療

• Usually 表現為 **cramping LLQ pain with overtly bloody stool;** fever and peritoneal signs should raise 臨床suspicion for infarction

• Disease spectrum: reversible colopathy (35%), transient colitis (15%), chronic ulcerating colitis (20%), resulting stricture (10%), gangrene (15%), fulminant colitis (<5%)

• Dx: **flex sig/colonoscopy** or **CT abd/pelvis** to make diagnosis; 排除 IBD, infectious colitis

• 治療: bowel rest, IV fluids, **broad-spectrum 抗生素**, serial abd exams; **surgery** for infarction, fulminant colitis, hemorrhage, failure of med Rx, recurrent sepsis, stricture

• Resolution within 48 h with conservative measures occurs in >50% of cases
