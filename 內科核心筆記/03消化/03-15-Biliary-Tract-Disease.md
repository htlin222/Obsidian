# BILIARY TRACT DISEASE

# CHOLELITHIASIS (GALLSTONES)

## 流行病學 & pathogenesis (_J Hepatol_ 2016;65:146; _Gastro_ 2016;151:351)

• Affects 10–20% of Western populations

• Bile = bile salts, phospholipids, cholesterol; ↑ cholesterol saturation in bile + accelerated nucleation + gallbladder hypomotility → gallstones

• Risk factors: ♀; South, Central, Native American; ↑ age (>40 y); obesity, TPN, rapid ↓ wt; dyslipidemia; preg., drugs (OCPs, estrogen, clofibrate, octreotide, Cftx); ileal dis., genetic

• Statin use ↓ risk of sx gallstones & cholecystectomy (_Hepatol Res_ 2015;45:942)

## Types of gallstones (_J Hepatol_ 2016;65:146)

• Cholesterol (90%): 2 subtypes

mixed: contain >50% cholesterol; typically smaller, multiple stones

pure: 100% cholesterol; larger, yellow, white appearance

• Pigment (10%)

_Black:_ unconjugated bili & calcium; seen with chronic hemolysis, cirrhosis, CF, Gilbert synd

_Brown:_ stasis & infxn in bile ducts → bacteria deconjugate bilirubin → precipitates with Ca; thus found pred in bile ducts; seen with duod. diverticula, biliary strictures, parasites

## 臨床表現

• Asx in ~80%. Biliary pain develops in 1–4%/y. Once sx, rate of complications ~1–3%/y.

• **Biliary pain** = **episodic RUQ or epigastric pain;** begins abruptly, continuous, resolves slowly and lasts 30 min–3 h; ± radiation to scapula; precip by **fatty foods**; **nausea**

• Physical exam: afebrile, ± RUQ tenderness or epigastric pain

## Diagnostic studies

• Labs normal in large majority

• RUQ U/S: Se & Sp >95% for stones >5 mm; can show complications (cholecystitis); should be performed only after fasting ≥8 h to ensure distended, bile-filled gallbladder

• Endoscopic US (EUS) Se 94–98% in 病人 with biliary pain but 正常 abd US (_J Hepatol_ 2016;65:146)

## 治療 
> (_Am Fam Physician_ 2014;89:795; _J Hepatol_ 2016;65:146)

• Cholecystectomy (CCY), usually laparoscopic, if symptomatic

• CCY in _asx_ 病人 if: GB calcification (↑ risk of cancer), GB polyps >10 mm, Native American, stones >3 cm; consider in morbidly obese undergoing bariatric surgery, cardiac Tx candidates, hemolytic anemia

• Ursodeoxycholic acid (rare) for cholesterol stones with uncomplicated biliary pain or if poor surgical candidate; also reduces risk of gallstone formation with rapid wt loss

• Pain: NSAIDs drug of choice, efficacy ≈ opiates & ↓ complic.

## Complications

• Cholecystitis: 20% of sx biliary pain → cholecystitis within 2 y

• Choledocholithiasis → cholangitis or gallstone pancreatitis

• Mirizzi syndrome: common hepatic duct obstruction by cystic duct stone → jaundice, biliary obstruction

• Cholecystenteric fistula: stone erodes through gallbladder into bowel

• Gallstone ileus: SBO (usually at term ileum) due to stone in intestine that passed thru fistula

• Gallbladder carcinoma: ~1% in U.S.

# CHOLECYSTITIS (_J Hepatol_ 2016;65:146; _World J Gastro Surg_ 2017;9:118)

## Pathogenesis

• Acute cholecystitis: stone impaction in cystic duct → inflammation behind obstruction → GB swelling ± secondary infection (50%) of biliary fluid

• Acalculous cholecystitis: GB stasis & ischemia (w/o cholelithiasis) → necroinflammation. Occurs in critically ill. A/w postop major surgery, TPN, sepsis, trauma, burns, opiates, immunosuppression, infxn (eg, CMV, _Candida_, _Crypto, Campylobacter_, typhoid fever).

## 臨床表現

• History: RUQ/epigastric pain ± radiation to R shoulder/back, nausea, vomiting, fever

• Physical exam: **RUQ tenderness**, **Murphy’s sign** = ↑ RUQ pain and inspiratory arrest with deep breath during palpation of R subcostal region, ± palpable gallbladder

• Laboratory evaluation: _may_ see ↑ WBC, ± mild ↑ bilirubin, Aφ, ALT/AST, amylase; if AST/ALT >500 U/L, bili >4 mg/dL or amylase >1000 U/L → choledocholithiasis

## Diagnostic studies

• **RUQ U**/**S:** high Se & Sp for stones, but need _specific signs of cholecystitis:_ GB wall thickening >4 mm, pericholecystic fluid and a sonographic Murphy’s sign

• **HIDA scan:** most Se test (80–90%) for acute cholecystitis. IV inj of HIDA (selectively secreted into bile). ⊕ if HIDA enters BD but not GB. 10–20% false ⊕ (cystic duct obstructed 2/2 chronic cholecystitis, lengthy fasting, liver disease).

## 治療 (_Ann Surg_ 2013;258:385; _NEJM_ 2015;373:357)

• NPO, IV fluids, nasogastric tube if intractable vomiting, analgesia

• **Antibiotics** (_E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ and _Enterobacter_ sp. are usual pathogens) (\[2nd\- or 3rd\-generation cephalosporin or FQ\] + MNZ) or piperacillin-tazobactam

• **CCY** (typically laparoscopic) within 24 h ↓ morbidity vs. waiting 7–45 d

• If unstable for surgery, EUS-guided transmural, ERCP-guided transcystic duct drainage, or percutaneous cholecystotomy (if without ascites or coagulopathy) are alternatives to CCY

• Intraoperative cholangiogram or ERCP to 排除 choledocholithiasis in 病人 with jaundice, cholangitis or stone in BD on U/S (see below)

## Complications

• Gangrenous cholecystitis: necrosis with risk of empyema and perforation

• Emphysematous cholecystitis: infection by gas-forming organisms (air in GB wall)

• Post CCY: bile duct leak, BD injury or retained stones, cystic duct remnant, sphincter of Oddi dysfxn

# CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS

## 定義

• Gallstone lodged in common bile duct (CBD)

## 流行病學

• Occurs in 15% of 病人 with gallbladder stones; can form de novo in CBD

## 臨床表現

• Asymptomatic

• RUQ/epigastric pain 2° obstrxn of bile flow → ↑ CBD pressure, jaundice, pruritus, nausea

Diagnostic studies (_Gastro Endo_ 2010;71:1; _J Hepatol_ 2016;65:146)

• Labs: ↑ bilirubin, Aϕ; transient spike in ALT or amylase suggests passage of stone

• RUQ U/S: BD stones seen ~50–80% of cases; usually inferred from dilated CBD (>6 mm)

• ERCP preferred modality when likelihood high (eg, visualized stone, cholangitis, bili >4, _or_ dilated CBD on U/S + bili 1.8–4 mg/dL); cholangiogram (percutaneous, operative) when ERCP unavailable or unsuccessful; EUS/MRCP to exclude BD stones when suspicion intermediate (eg, no stone, but: dilated ducts on US, bili 1.8–4 mg/dL, gallstone panc., age >55, or 異常 non-bili LFT)

## 治療

• ERCP & papillotomy with stone extraction (± lithotripsy)

• CCY typically within 6 wk unless contraindication (>15% 病人 will develop indication for CCY if left unRx’d)

Complications

• Cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, stricture

# CHOLANGITIS

## 定義 & 原因

• BD obstruction → infection proximal to the obstruction

• 原因: **BD stone** (~85%)

Malignant (biliary, pancreatic) or benign stricture

Infection with fluke (_Clonorchis sinensis_, _Opisthorchis viverrini_)

## 臨床表現

• Charcot’s triad: RUQ pain, jaundice, fever/chills; present in ~70% of 病人

• Reynolds’ pentad: Charcot’s triad + shock and Δ MS; present in ~15% of 病人

## Diagnostic studies

• RUQ U/S: often demonstrates dilation

• Labs: ↑ WBC (with left shift), bilirubin, Aφ, amylase; may see ⊕ BCx

• ERCP; percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram if ERCP unsuccessful

## 治療

• **Antibiotics** (broad spectrum) to cover common bile pathogens (see above) ampicillin + gentamicin (or levofloxacin) ± MNZ (if severe); carbapenems; pip/tazo

• ~80% respond to conservative Rx and 抗生素 → biliary drainage on elective basis

• ~20% require **urgent biliary decompression** via ERCP (papillotomy, stone extraction and/or stent insertion). If sphincterotomy cannot be performed (larger stones), decompression by biliary stent or nasobiliary catheter can be done; otherwise, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage or surgery.
