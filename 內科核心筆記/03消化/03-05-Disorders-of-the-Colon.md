# DISORDERS OF THE COLON

# DIVERTICULOSIS

## 定義 & 病生理 (_Aliment Pharm Ther_ 2015;42:664)

• Acquired herniations of colonic mucosa & submucosa in areas where vasa recta penetrate

• Thought to occur in setting of abnormal motility and ↑ intraluminal pressure

## 流行病學

• Risk factors: ↓ fiber, ↑ red meat, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, EtOH, NSAIDs

• Prevalence higher with ↑ age (10% if <40 y; 50–66% if >80 y); “Westernized” societies

• **Left side** (90%, mostly sigmoid) > R side of colon (except in Asia where 75–85% R-sided)

## 臨床表現

• Usually asx, but 5–15% develop diverticular hemorrhage (see “GIB”) and <5% diverticulitis

• Limited data for ↑ fiber diet or avoiding nuts/seeds (_Ther Adv Gastro_ 2016;9:213)

# DIVERTICULITIS

## 病生理 (_Gastro_ 2015;149:1944; _Am J Gastro_ 2018;112:1868)

• Retention of undigested food and bacteria in diverticulum → fecalith formation → obstruction → compromise of diverticulum’s blood supply, infection, perforation

• **Uncomplicated:** microperforation → localized infection

• **Complicated** (15%): macroperf → abscess, peritonitis, fistula (65% with bladder), obstrxn

## 臨床表現

• **LLQ abdominal pain**, **fever**, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea

• PEx ranges from LLQ tenderness ± palpable mass to peritoneal signs & septic shock

• Ddx includes IBD, infectious colitis, PID, tubal pregnancy, cystitis, colorectal cancer

## Diagnostic studies

• Plain abdominal radiographs to 排除 free air, ileus or obstruction

• **Abdominal CT** (I+O+): >95% Se & Sp; assess complicated disease (abscess, fistula)

• Colonoscopy _contraindic._ acutely as ↑ risk of perforation; do 6–8 wk after to 排除 neoplasm

## 治療 (_JAMA_ 2017;318:291; _Dig Surg_ 2017;34:151; _NEJM_ 2018;379:1635)

• Mild: outPt Rx indicated if Pt has few comorbidities and can tolerate POs

PO 抗生素: (MNZ + FQ) or amox/clav for 7–10 d; liquid diet until 臨床improvement

Possible that 抗生素 not needed for uncomplicated diverticulitis (_Br J Surg_ 2017;104:52)

• Severe: inPt Rx if cannot take POs, narcotics needed for pain, or complications

NPO, IVF, NGT (if ileus); IV 抗生素 (GNR & anaerobic coverage; eg, CTX/MNZ or pip-tazo)

• Abscesses >4 cm should be drained percutaneously or surgically

• Surgery: if progression despite med Rx, undrainable abscess, free perforation

Resection superior to laparoscopic lavage (_JAMA_ 2015;314:1364), but lavage may be suitable for perforation with purulent peritonitis (_Annals_ 2016;164:137)

After source control, 4 d 抗生素 may be sufficient (_NEJM_ 2015;372:1996)

Resection for recurrent bouts of diverticulitis on a case-by-case basis

Consider lower threshold for urgent & elective surgery for immunocompromised 病人

## Prevention (_Cochrane_ CD009839; _Am J Gastro_ 2016;11:579; _Ann Gastro_ 2016;29:24)

• Mesalamine + rifaximin both with weak evidence

• Risk of recurrence 10–30% within 10 y of 1st episode; more likely 2nd episode complicated

# POLYPS & ADENOMAS

## 病生理 & 流行病學 (_NEJM_ 2016;374:1065)

• Accumulation of mutations in colonic epithelial cell DNA affecting oncogenes & tumor suppressor genes → _tumor initiation_ (formation of adenoma; _APC_ loss of fxn) → _tumor progression_ (adenoma → carcinoma; _K-ras_ gain of fxn, _DCC, p53_ loss of fxn)

• Risk factors: ↑ age, FHx (sporadic in 1° relatives, Lynch, FAP), IBD, ↑ dietary fat, central adiposity, ↑ EtOH, ↓ fiber, ↑ red meat, ? smoking, DM

• Protective factors: ↑ physical activity, ASA/NSAIDs, Ca2+ intake, HRT, ↓ BMI; possibly ↑ fiber, vitamin D, fish oil, statins, selenium

• Neoplastic polyps: adenomas (tubular, villous, tubulovillous dysplasia), sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (concern for interval CRC), carcinomas

• Nonneoplastic polyps: hyperplastic, juvenile, Peutz-Jeghers, inflammatory

## Detection

• _Colonoscopy_ is gold standard

• Recommended in all 病人 starting at age 50 (Amer Cancer Soc. rec age 45) and then typically q10y unless pathology found

• If ⊕ FHx, start age 40, or 10 y before age of dx in youngest family member, repeat q5y
