# ABNORMAL LIVER TESTS

## Tests of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis (_J Clin Transl Hepatol_ 2017;5:394)

• **Aminotransferases** (AST, ALT): intracellular enzymes released 2° necrosis/inflammation

ALT more specific for liver than is AST (heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, RBC/WBC)

↑ levels seen with most types of hepatocellular injury; skeletal musc. injury, MI (AST > ALT)

• **Alkaline phosphatase** (Aϕ): enzyme bound in hepatic canalicular membrane ↑ levels seen with biliary obstrxn or intrahepatic cholestasis also found in bone, intestines, kidney, placenta; confirm from liver with: ↑ GGT (or ↑ 5′-NT)

• **Bilirubin:** product of heme metab (unconjugated, “indirect”) carried by alb to liver where taken up for conjugation (“direct”) to make soluble, then excreted into bile.

↑ direct hyperbili seen with cholestasis, enzymatic disorders (eg, Dubin-Johnson, Rotor’s)

↑ indirect hyperbili seen with hemolysis, enzymatic disorders (eg, Crigler-Najjar, Gilbert’s)

jaundice seen when bili >2.5 mg/dL (esp. in sclera or under tongue); if hyperbili conjugated then ↑ urine bilirubin

## Tests of hepatic function

• **Albumin:** marker for liver protein synthesis, ↓ slowly in liver failure (t1/2 ~15–18 d)

• **Prothrombin time** (PT): depends on synthesis of coag factors by liver (except FVIII); b/c t½ of some factors (eg, V, VII) is short, ↑ PT can occur within hrs of liver dysfxn

• **R-value** = ratio of ALT:Aϕ normalized to ULN for each = (ALT/ULN) ÷ (Aϕ/ULN)

R >5 suggests hepatocellular injury, <2 suggests cholestatic injury, 2–5 suggests mixed

### • **Workup for _acute_ enzyme elevation** (often symptomatic)

Severe ALT & AST elevation (>1000):

_toxins_ (usu. acetaminophen) → ✔ tox screen, EtOH, acet. levels. Other toxins: INH, disulfiram, pyrazinamide, OTC/herbal, fenofibrate, niacin, amiodarone, MDMA.

_ischemia_ (eg, sepsis, hypotension, Budd Chiari) → ✔ liver U/S with Doppler. 原因 usually lead to ↑ LDH, ∴ usually ratio ALT:LDH <1.5 (vs. >1.5 with toxins, viruses).

_viruses_ (Hep A-E; HSV, CMV, VZV) → ✔ viral serologies

_other_ (AIH, acute Wilson Disease, acute biliary obstrxn) → see ALF & cirrhosis sections

Acute mild-moderate ALT & AST elevation: as above, think meds/toxins (_see list at end of section_), viruses, ischemia/vascular issues in hospitalized 病人, obstruction (if mixed picture), systemic disease (_see “Workup for chronic enzyme elevation,”_ below)

### • **Workup for _chronic_ enzyme elevation** (often asymptomatic)

Screen for common causes: hep serologies, EtOH, liver U/S (? NAFLD, cirrhosis), meds

If suspect underlying systemic disease: iron studies (HFE); ANA, ASMA, Ig levels (AIH); ceruloplasmin, urinary copper (Wilson); α1-AT (can cause liver dis even without lung involvement); celiac screening; thyroid studies; see “Cirrhosis”

If ⊖ evaluation → lifestyle modification (wt loss, DM control) & repeat testing 3–6 mo

If evidence of chronic liver disease or persistent lab 異常, consider liver bx
