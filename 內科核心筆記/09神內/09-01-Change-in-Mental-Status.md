# CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS

Consciousness/Arousal (description of patient & timing is most helpful)

• **Arousal:** spectrum from awake/alert → drowsy → stupor → coma. Terms vague & subjective, so most useful to describe response to increasing stimulation (eg, voice → noxious).

• **Coma:** lack of response to external stimuli. Degree formalized in Glasgow Coma Scale. Caused by focal lesions in brainstem (reticular activating system), thalamus, or diffuse dysfxn of both cerebral hemispheres. Mimics: locked-in synd., akinetic mutism, catatonia.

• **Delirium/acute confusional state:** altered attention & awareness, develops over hrs to days, often fluctuating, accompanied by cognitive Δs (eg, disorientation, memory loss, perceptual Δs); sometimes with sleep–wake dysregulation, autonomic Δs, emotionality

• **Dementia:** progressive cognitive impairment developing over mos to yrs; often affects memory, language, visuospatial and executive function; attention often spared

Initial evaluation

• **History** (witness & background _crucial_): tempo, premorbid sx (eg, focal neuro deficits, HA, infxn, pain, falls), medical conditions (eg, dementia, epilepsy, onc, cardiac, psych, infection/immune status), accompanied by head trauma, current meds (eg, sedatives, opioids, anticoag, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants), drug/alcohol use

• **General exam:** _VS_, breathing pattern (eg, Cheyne-Stokes), tongue bite (seizure), _nuchal rigidity_ (meningitis, SAH; _do not test_ if c/f trauma/cervical spine fx), ecchymoses, rash, signs of head trauma (eg, Battle sign, raccoon eyes, hemotympanum, CSF rhinorrhea), asterixis, liver disease stigmata, embolic phenomena/endocarditis, signs and symptoms drug use

• **Neuro exam** (see below): perform off sedatives/paralytics if possible, look for focal deficits suggesting structural cause (eg, stroke, herniation), signs and symptoms of ↑ ICP (eg, HA, vomiting, papilledema, abducens nerve palsy, unilateral dilated pupil, ↑ BP/↓ HR, fixed downgaze)

Initial 治療

• Empiric antibiotics if c/f CNS infection: vancomycin/CTX, consider acyclovir and ampicillin

• Immobilization of C-spine if concern for cervical trauma

• Thiamine 100 mg IV → dextrose 50 g IVP (this order to prevent exacerbation of Wernicke’s)

• If opiates suspected: naloxone 0.01 mg/kg; if BDZ suspected, consider flumazenil 0.2mg IV

• If concern for ↑ ICP ± herniation: ↑ head of bed; osmotherapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline; ↑ ventilation; dexamethasone for tumor edema; c/s neurosurgery (? decompress)

Diagnostic studies (_Lancet_ 2014;384:2064)

• All patients: check fingerstick glucose, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, LFTs, CBC, tox screen, U/A

• _Based on 臨床suspicion:_

Labs: NH3, TSH, cort stim, B12, ABG, HIV, ESR, ANA, TPO/anti-TG, BCx, drug levels

Imaging: head CT, then MRI; CTA if c/f stroke/SAH; radiographs to 排除 C-spine fracture

Lumbar puncture to 排除 meningitis, SAH, or noninfectious inflammation (eg, autoimmune)

EEG to evaluate for nonconvulsive seizures, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy

Further 治療 of delirium (_NEJM_ 2017;377:1456)

• Treat underlying acute illness, eliminate precipitating factors, & provide supportive care

• Address sensory & cognitive impairments (frequent reorientation, glasses/hearing aids, etc.)

• Decrease/prevent infection/restraints if possible, remove lines/catheters if unnecessary

• Promote good sleep: reduce noise & nighttime interventions; sedative med if necessary

• Meds: consider antipsychotics (but neither haloperidol nor ziprasidone ↓ delirium duration in ICU 病人; _NEJM_ 2018;379:2506); avoid benzos except in EtOH withdrawal or seizures

ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY (at risk if ≥5 min cerebral hypoxia)

Initial evaluation (_Circulation_ 2010:S768)

• Neuro exam: arousal/verbal, eyes & other cranial nerves, motor response to pain

• Imaging: CT usually not informative within first day after arrest, but should be done prior to initiating hypothermia if patient found down or has had head trauma

Targeted temperature management (_Circulation_ 2015;132:2448)

• Indications: comatose (GCS <8) within 6h after cardiac arrest (not isolated resp. arrest). Studied only in VT/VF, but consider after asystole or PEA, or 6–12h post-arrest.

• Exclusions: pregnancy, CV instability despite pressors/assist devices, other cause of coma, persistent ↓ O2. Relative contraindications: major head trauma, coagulopathy/bleeding, major surgery <14d, systemic infection/sepsis.

• Target temp: 32–36°C × ≥24h. Initial studies showing benefit targeted 32–34°C, but subsequent study showed ≈ outcomes for 36°C vs. 33°C (_NEJM_ 2013;369:2197). Some still target 32–34°C and reserve 36°C for 病人 with contraindic to more aggressive cooling.

• Method: ice packs to head/neck/torso; cooling blankets; cooling vest or endovascular catheter. Goal to achieve target temp <6h (but no benefit to prehosp cooling; _JAMA_ 2014;311:45). 病人 should be sedated/paralyzed while cooled. MAP goal >70. Start rewarming 24h after cooling is initiated (rewarm ≤0.5°C per h).

• In 病人 not cooled or after rewarming 病人 who were cooled: prevent fever (goal <36°C) for ≥48h post arrest

• Complications

Dysrhythmias (brady most common): if significant or hemodynamic instability → rewarm

Coagulopathy (can receive lytics, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, etc.); monitor PT & PTT

Infection: monitor surveillance blood cultures during cooling

Hyperglycemia during cooling, hypoglycemia with rewarming; stop insulin if glc <200 mg/dL

Hypokalemia during cooling, hyperkalemia with rewarming; keep K 4–5 mEq/L

Ongoing evaluation

• Neuro exam: daily focus on coma exam. No exam finding is reliable <24 h or on sedation. Should be off sedation for adequate time (depends on dose, duration, Pt’s metabolism).

• Labs: daily CBC, PT/PTT, electrolytes. Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) on days 1–3.

• Imaging: noncontrast CT 24 h after arrest; if unrevealing, consider MRI around days 3–5

• EEG: consider in all to exclude seizures; greatest risk during rewarming

• Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP): helpful for prediction of poor outcome if cortical responses are absent bilaterally; perform 48 h after arrest (72 h if cooled)

Prognosis (_Nat Rev Neuro_ 2014;10:190)

• Prior to cooling era, poor prognosis at 72 h if absent pupillary & corneal reflexes and no motor response to pain; or absent SSEPs at 48 h. With cooling, unclear if prior measures as reliable. Overall ~12% survive to hosp. d/c; VT/VF 25-40%, PEA ~10%, asystole ~2%.

• Prognosis requires multifactorial assessment based on age, exam, comorbidities, ancillary data. Poor signs: absent brainstem reflexes, Rx-resistant myoclonus, EEG with absent background/reactivity, NSE >33, diffuse hypoxic injury on MRI. If doubt, err on more time.
