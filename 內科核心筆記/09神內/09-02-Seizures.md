# SEIZURES

定義 & 臨床表現 (_Epilepsia_ 2017;58:522)

• **Seizure:** transient neurologic symptoms due to excessive synchronous neuronal activity; may be _provoked_ by a reversible factor lowering the seizure threshold, or _unprovoked_

• **Epilepsy:** ≥2 unprovoked seizures occurring >24 h apart _or_ 1 unprovoked seizure with ≥60% probability of further seizures over the next 10 y (see below for prognostication)

• **Generalized seizures** (involves brain diffusely)

_Tonic-clonic_ (grand mal):

### Aura (sec to mins): premonition with paresthesias, focal motor contractions, abnormal smells/tastes, fear, depersonalization, déjà vu, autonomic changes, automatisms

### Ictal period (sec to mins): lateral gaze and head deviation, tonic contraction of muscles → intermittent relaxing and tensing of muscles, tongue biting, urinary incontinence, pooling of secretions, incontinence

### Postictal period (mins to h): slowly resolving period of confusion, disorientation, and lethargy. May be accompanied by focal neurologic deficits (Todd’s paralysis).

_Absence_ (petit mal): transient lapse of consciousness without loss of postural tone, usu pedi

_Myoclonic_ (infantile spasms & juvenile myoclonic epilepsy): sudden, brief contraction

• **Focal seizures** (involves discrete brain area, often associated with a structural lesion)

_w/o impaired awareness:_ focal motor/autonomic sx (formerly “simple partial seizure”) or focal sensory/psychic symptoms (eg, aura)

_w/ impaired awareness:_ dyscognitive features (formerly “complex partial seizure”)

_evolving to bilateral, convulsive seizure_ (formerly “secondarily generalized seizure”)

• **Status epilepticus:** continuous convulsive seizure ≥5 min or >2 seizures without resolution of postictal encephalopathy; _life threatening_

• **Nonconvulsive status epilepticus:** alteration of awareness (ranging from confusion to coma) without motor 表現 of seizure; dx with EEG

Differential diagnosis

• **Syncope** (_Lancet Neurol_ 2006;5:171)

• **Nonepileptic seizure** (aka “psychogenic”): may see side-to-side head turning, asymmetric large-amplitude limb movements, hip thrusting, diffuse shaking without LOC, crying/talking during event; diagnosis requires spell capture on EEG with no EEG correlate

• Other: metabolic disorders (eg, alcoholic blackouts, hypoglycemia), migraine, TIA, transient global amnesia, narcolepsy (cataplexy), nonepileptic myoclonus, tics, asterixis

原因 of seizures (vary strongly by age)

• **withoutut focal lesion:** genetic predisposition to seizures or epilepsy syndrome; alcohol withdrawal, illicit drugs; meds (eg, β-lactams, bupropion, fluoroquinolones, tramadol, MNZ, meperidine, CsA); electrolyte (hyponatremia) & other metabolic (eg, uremia, liver failure, hypoglycemia); autoimmune encephalitis, idiopathic (~60%)

• **With focal lesion:** tumor, trauma, stroke, subdural hematomas, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, mesial temporal sclerosis, abscess, focal cortical dysplasia

臨床evaluation (_JAMA_ 2016;316:2657)

• _History key in differentiating seizure from other causes of transient loss of consciousness._ Must talk to witnesses. Ask about prodrome, unusual behavior before spell, type & pattern of 異常 movements incl. head turning & eye deviation (gaze preference usually _away_ from seizure focus), loss of responsiveness.

• Recent events: illnesses/fevers, head trauma, sleep deprivation, stressors

• PMH: prior seizures or ⊕ FHx; prior CNS infection, stroke or head trauma; dementia

• Medications (new or noncompliance), alcohol and illicit drug use

• General physical exam should include the skin, looking for neuroectodermal disorders (eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) that are a/w seizures

• Neurologic exam should look for focal abnormalities → underlying structural abnormality

Diagnostic studies (_Neurology_ 2007;69:1996)

• Lab: full lytes, BUN, Cr, glc, LFTs, tox screen, AED levels (valproic acid and phenytoin have therapeutic range; levetiracetam level rarely useful unless ? noncompliance), illicit drug screen

• Routine EEG (~30 min): may help determine risk of seizure recurrence after 1st\-time unprovoked seizure. Caveat: interictal EEG 正常 in 50% of 病人 with epilepsy, and interictal epileptiform activity (spikes or sharp waves) seen in up to 2% of 正常 population; EEG within 24h, sleep deprivation and repeated studies ↑ dx yield of EEG.

• Long-term EEG monitoring (hrs to days): if suspicion for non-convulsive status or non-epileptic seizures; video monitoring may help with nonepileptic seizures

• MRI to 排除 structural abnormalities; ↑ Se with fine coronal imaging of frontal & temporal lobes

• LP (if no space-occupying lesion on imaging): if suspect meningoencephalitis (eg, fever, ↑ WBC, nuchal rigidity) or autoimmune encephalitis and in _all_ HIV ⊕ 病人

治療 (_Neurology_ 2015;84:1705; _Lancet_ 2015;385:884)

• Treat any underlying precipitants, including CNS infections, intoxication, withdrawal, etc.

• Antiepileptic drug (AED) Rx usually reserved for 病人 with ≥2 _unprovoked_ seizures, single seizure with high risk of recurrence (see below), or underlying structural abnormality. _Provoked_ seizures generally treated by addressing underlying cause; consider AED if status epilepticus on presentation, focal neuro exam, postictal Todd’s paralysis.

• After 1st unprovoked sz, weigh risks of recurrence vs AED. ↑ risk of recurrence if 異常 EEG, MRI, or nocturnal sz. If EEG & MRI 正常 → 65% sz-free at 5 y (_Lancet Neurol_ 2006;5:317).

• Immediate 治療 with AED after 1st unprovoked seizure ↓ risk of recurrence over 2 y, but does not Δ long-term prognosis

• If AED Rx indicated, choice dependent on type of seizure, side effects, cost, mechanism of elimination (if hepatic or renal insufficiency), teratogenesis, and drug interactions

• Introduce gradually, monitor carefully

• May consider withdrawal of meds if seizure free (typically for at least 1 y) and normal EEG

• Individual state laws mandate seizure-free duration before being allowed to drive

Status epilepticus (_Epilepsy Curr_ 2016;16:48)

• ABCs: vital signs, oral airway or endotracheal intubation. Place Pt in semiprone position to ↓ risk of aspiration. Obtain IV access. Give thiamine, dextrose, IV normal saline.

• STAT glc, metabolic panel, CBC, tox screen, lactate, AED levels, consider head CT, LP

• Start standing AED after loading dose.

PE, phenytoin equivalents. \*Consider PR diazepam if no IV access and IM midazolam is contraindicated.
