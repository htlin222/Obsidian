![](https://i.imgur.com/oauTgnk.jpg)

PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES

原因 based on presentation

• **Mononeuropathy** (1 nerve): _acute_ → trauma; _chronic_ → entrapment, compression, DM, Lyme. Common: median n. (carpal tunnel); ulnar n. (elbow or wrist); radial n. (spiral groove); com. peroneal n. (fibular head with leg crossing); lat. femoral cutan. n. (inguinal lig)

• **Mononeuropathy multiplex** (axonal loss of multiple, noncontig. nerves): vasculitic synd. (eg, PAN, Churg–Strauss, Wegener’s, SLE, RA, Sjögren’s, cryo, HCV), DM, Lyme, HIV, leprosy, hereditary neurop. with pressure palsies, infiltrative (sarcoid, lymphoma, leukemia)

• **Polyneuropathy** (multiple symmetric nerves, generally length dependent): 30% idiopathic;

_W/ autonomic features:_ DM, EtOH, paraneoplastic, B12 def, amyloid, chemo, 1° dysauto

_Painful (small fiber nerves):_ DM, EtOH, amyloid, chemo, sarcoid, heavy metals, porphyria

_Demyelinating._ Acute: AIDP (Guillain-Barré), diphtheria. Subacute: meds (taxanes), paraneoplastic. Chronic: idiopathic, DM, CIDP, anti-MAG, HIV, hypothyroidism, toxins, paraproteinemia, hereditary (eg, CMT).

_Axonal._ Acute: acute motor axonal neuropathy, porphyria, vasculitis, uremia, critical illness. Subacute: EtOH, sepsis, paraneoplastic, meds (cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine, INH, ddI, amio). Chronic: DM, uremia, lead, arsenic, HIV, paraproteinemia, B12 defic.

臨床表現

• Weakness, fasciculations, cramps, numbness, dysesthesias (burning/tingling), allodynia

• ± Autonomic dysfxn (orthostasis, constipation, urinary retention, impotence, 異常 sweating)

• Depressed or absent DTRs (may be normal in small fiber neuropathy)

Diagnostic studies

• Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: CBC, lytes, BUN/Cr, HbA1C, B12, TSH, ESR, SPEP + IF

• EMG/NCS (often no change in 1st 10–14 d or in small-fiber neuropathy)

• Based on H&P: LFTs, ANA, anti-Ro/La, HIV, Cu, Lyme, RPR, UA, UPEP+IF, ACE, ANCA, heavy metals, LP (AIDP/CIDP), cryo, paraneoplastic Abs, genetic testing. Autonomic testing/skin bx (small fiber), nerve bx (mononeuropathy multiplex), fat pad bx (amyloid).

• MRI if possible radiculopathy or plexopathy (after EMG)

Pharmacologic 治療 of neuropathic pain (_Lancet Neurol_ 2015;14:162)

• Gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs (nortriptyline, amitriptyline), SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine)

• 2nd line: tramadol, topicals (lido, capsaicin); 3rd line: nerve block, botulinum toxin A

GUILLAIN\-BARRÉ SYNDROME (GBS)

定義 & 流行病學 (_Nat Rev Neurol_ 2014;10:469)

• AIDP (60–80%); acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN; 7–30%; a/w anti-GM1, anti-GD1a Abs; worse prognosis); Miller Fisher synd. (ophthalmoplegia & ataxia; a/w anti-GQ1b Ab)

• Incidence 1–2 per 100,000; most common acute/subacute paralysis

• Precipitants in 60%: viral illness (influenza, CMV, EBV, HIV, Zika), URI (_Mycoplasma_), gastroenteritis (_Campylobacter_), Lyme, immunizations (no proven risk with current), surgery

臨床表現 (_Lancet_ 2016;388:717)

• Pain (55–90%), distal sensory dysesthesias & numbness often 1st sx, back pain common

• Progressive symmetric paralysis in legs and arms over hrs to days; plateau in 1–4 wk

• Hypoactive then absent reflexes. <10% with reflexes on presentation, but all develop hypo/areflexia during course. Minority of AMAN with preserved reflexes throughout.

• Resp failure requiring mech vent occurs in 25%; autonomic instability & arrhythmias in 60%

Diagnostic studies (results may be normal in first several days)

• LP: albuminocytologic dissociation = ↑ protein without pleocytosis (<10 WBCs) seen in up to 64% of 病人. ↑ protein in ½ in 1st wk, ¾ by 3rd wk of sx. Unlikely to be GBS if WBC >50

• EMG/NCS: ↓ conduction velocity, conduction block, 異常 F-waves; can be 正常 in 1st 2 wk

• FVC & NIF: to assess for risk of resp. failure (cannot rely on PaO2 or SaO2 alone)

### 治療

• Plasma exchange or IVIg of equal efficacy (_Neuro_ 2012;78:1009); steroids not beneficial

• Supportive care with monitoring in ICU setting if rapid progression or resp. failure

• Watch for autonomic dysfunction: labile BP, dysrhythmias (telemetry)

• Erasmus GBS outcome score can help with prognostication (_Lancet Neurol_ 2007;6:589). Most recover near baseline in 1 y; 3–5% mortality. Residual deficits: pain, fatigue.

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (MG)

定義 & 流行病學 (_Lancet Neurol_ 2015;14:1023; _NEJM_ 2016;375:2570)

• Autoimmune disorder with Ab against acetylcholine receptor (AChR, 80%), muscle-specific kinase (MusK, 4%), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4, 2%), or other NMJ proteins

• Prevalence: 1 in 7500; affects all ages, peak incidence 20s–30s (women), 60s–70s (men)

• 15% of AchR MG a/w thymoma; 30% of 病人 with thymoma develop AchR MG

臨床表現

• Fluctuating weakness with _fatigability_ (worse with repetitive use, relieved by rest)

• Cranial muscles involved early → 60% present initially with ocular sx (ptosis, diplopia); 20% will only have ocular sx; 15% with bulbar (difficulty chewing, dysarthria, dysphagia)

• Limb weakness proximal > distal; DTRs preserved; minimal/no atrophy

• MusK MG (F >> M): mostly cranial/bulbar, neck, and resp weakness

• Exacerb. triggered by stressors: URI, surgery, preg/postpartum, meds (eg, Mg, AG, macro-lides, FQ, procainamide, phenytoin, D-penicillamine). Prednisone can _worsen_ sx acutely.

• Myasthenic crisis = sx exacerbation, risk of respiratory compromise

• Cholinergic crisis = weakness due to _over治療_ with anticholinesterase meds; may have excessive salivation, abdominal cramping and diarrhea; rare at normal doses

Diagnostic studies

• Bedside: ptosis at baseline or after >45 sec of sustained upgaze; improved ptosis with ice pack over eyes for 2–5 min (Se 77%, Sp 98%)

• Neostigmine test: temporary ↑ strength; false ⊕ & ⊖ occur; premedicate with atropine

• EMG: ↓ response with repetitive nerve stimulation (vs. ↑ response in Lambert-Eaton)

• Anti-AChR Ab (Se 80%, 50% if ocular disease only, Sp >90%); muscle specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) Ab; AchR modulating Ab

• CT or MRI of thorax to evaluate thymus (65% hyperplasia, 10% thymoma)

治療

• Thymectomy if thymoma and in Ab ⊕ 病人 without thymoma (_NEJM_ 2016;375:511)

• Cholinesterase inhibitor (eg, pyridostigmine) is most rapid acting (benefit in 30–60 min). Less effective for MusK MG. Side effects: cholinergic stim (brady, diarrhea, drooling).

• Immunosuppression: prednisone (benefit in wks; don’t start during crisis) + AZA (benefit in 6–15 mo). If no response: mycophenolate, rituximab, MTZ, CsA. Goal to taper off steroids

• Myasthenic crisis: treat precipitant; consider d/c cholinesterase inhibitor if suspect cholinergic crisis. IVIg or plasmapheresis; if no response, high-dose glucocorticoids (in monitored setting b/c risk for initial worsening). ICU if rapid or severe (follow FVC, NIF).

MYOPATHIES

原因

• Hereditary: Duchenne, Becker, limb-girdle, myotonic, metabolic, mitochondrial

• Endocrine: hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing syndrome

• Toxic: statins, fibrates, glucocorticoids, zidovudine, alcohol, cocaine, antimalarials, colchicine, penicillamine

• Infectious: HIV, HTLV-1, trichinosis, toxoplasmosis

• Inflammatory: polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, anti-HMGCR

臨床表現

• Progressive or episodic weakness (not fatigue)

• Weakness most often symmetric, proximal > distal (stairs, rising from sitting, etc.)

• ± Myalgias (though not prominent or frequent), cramps, myotonia (impaired relaxation)

• May develop either pseudohypertrophy (dystrophies) or mild muscle atrophy

• Assoc. organ dysfxn: cardiac (arrhythmia, CHF), pulmonary (ILD), dysmorphic features

Diagnostic studies

• CK, aldolase, LDH, electrolytes, ALT/AST, PTH, TSH, ESR, HIV

• Autoantibodies: ANA, RF, anti-Jo1, antisynthetase, anti-Mi-2, anti-SRP, anti-HMGCR (if statin use), 5TN1CA (in inclusion body myositis)

• EMG/NCS: low-amplitude, polyphasic units with early recruitment, ± fibrillation potentials

• Muscle biopsy, molecular genetic testing (where indicated)

• Age-appropriate cancer screening if polymyositis or dermatomyositis suspected
