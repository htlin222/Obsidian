# ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES

FEVER AND NEUTROPENIA (FN) (_NCCN Guidelines_ v.1.2019)

定義

• Fever: single oral temp ≥38.3°C (101°F) or ≥38°C (100.4°F) for ≥1 h

• **Neutropenia:** ANC <500 cells/µL or <1000 cells/µL with predicted nadir <500 cells/µL

病生理 and microbiology

• Predisposing factors: catheters, skin breakdown, GI mucositis, obstruction (lymphatics, biliary tract, GI, urinary tract), immune defect associated with malignancy

• Most episodes thought to result from seeding of bloodstream by GI flora

• Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis): RLQ pain, watery/bloody diarrhea, cecal wall thickening

• GNRs (esp. _P. aeruginosa_) were historically most common

• Gram ⊕ infections have recently become more common (60–70% of identified organisms)

• Fungal superinfection often results from prolonged neutropenia & antibiotic use

Prevention (only if intermediate or high-risk)

• Bacterial: consider fluoroquinolone if neutropenic; no mortality Δ (_NEJM_ 2005;353:977 & 988)

• Fungal: consider during neutropenia in blood cancers (posa/fluconazole, micafungin)

• Viral: consider during active Rx in blood cancers (acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir)

Diagnostic evaluation

• Exam: skin, oropharynx, lung, perirectal area, surgical & catheter sites; avoid DRE

• Labs: CBC with differential, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, LFTs, U/A

• Micro: blood (peripheral & through each indwelling catheter port), urine, & sputum cx; for localizing signs and symptoms → ✔ stool (_C. difficile_, cx), peritoneal fluid, CSF (rare source)

• Imaging: CXR; for localizing signs and symptoms → CNS, sinus, chest or abdomen/pelvis imaging

• Caveats: neutropenia → impaired inflammatory response → _exam and radiographic findings may be subtle;_ absence of neutrophils by Gram stain does _not_ 排除 infection

Risk stratification (factors that predict lower risk)

• History: outPt, ECOG 0-1, age <60 y, solid tumor, no sx, no major comorbidities, no h/o fungal infection, MASCC Risk Index ≥21 (_Support Care Cancer_ 2013;21:1487)

• Exam: temp <39 °C, no tachypnea, no HoTN, no Δ MS, no dehydration

• Labs: ANC >100 cells/µL, anticipated duration of neutropenia ≤100 cells/µL <7 d

Initial antibiotic therapy (_NCCN Guidelines_ v.1.2019)

• Empiric regimens should include **antipseudomonal activity;** consider VRE coverage if ⊕

• **Low risk:** PO 抗生素 or home IV 抗生素 may be considered in select 病人;

PO options: cipro+amoxicillin-clavulanate; levofloxacin; moxifloxacin (avoid if FQ ppx)

• **High risk: hospital admission & IV 抗生素;** monotherapy preferred

options: cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime

• **Vancomycin** if HoTN, PNA, clinically apparent catheter-related or soft-tissue infxn, gram ⊕ BCx, mucositis on quinolone ppx & ceftazidime for viridans strep; d/c when BCx ⊖ × 48 h

Modification to initial antibiotic regimen based on site-specific evaluation

• Mouth/esophageal (ulcer, thrush): consider anaerobic, anti-HSV and/or antifungal Rx

• Sinus/nasal: add vanc if periorbital cellulitis, ampho if concern for Aspergillus/Mucor

• Abd pain/diarrhea: PO vanc if concern for _C. diff_; ensure adequate anaerobic coverage

• Lung infiltrates: consider atypical coverage; vanc/linezolid if c/f MRSA; TMP/SMX if c/f PCP

• CNS: ID consult; empiric meningitis Rx (incl. _Listeria_), high-dose acyclovir for encephalitis

• Antifungal Rx added for neutropenic fever ≥5 d despite 抗生素. Liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin, voriconazole, & posaconazole are options.

Duration of therapy

• Known 

• Unknown 

• Less clear when to d/c 抗生素 when Pt is afebrile but prolonged neutropenia

Role of hematopoietic growth factors (_NCCN Guidelines_ 2.2018)

• Granulocyte (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-CSF) colony-stimulating factors can be used as 1° prophylaxis when expected FN incidence >20% or as 2° prophylaxis after FN has occurred in a previous cycle (to maintain dose-intensity for curable tumors). CSFs ↓ rate of FN but have not been shown to affect mortality (_Cochrane_ 2014 CD003039).

• Colony-stimulating factors can be considered as adjuvant therapy in high-risk FN 病人

SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION

臨床表現 (_Lancet Neuro_ 2008;7:459)

• Metastases located in vertebral body extend and cause epidural spinal cord compression

• **Prostate**, **breast**, and **lung** cancers are most common, followed by RCC, NHL, myeloma

• **Site of involvement: thoracic** (60%), lumbar (25%), cervical (15%)

• Signs and symptoms: **pain** (>95%, _precedes neuro_ Δ_s_), **weakness**, **autonomic dysfunction** (urinary retention, ↓ anal sphincter tone), **sensory loss**

Diagnostic evaluation

• Always take back pain in 病人 with solid tumors very seriously

• **Do _not_ wait for neurologic signs to develop** before initiating evaluation b/c duration & severity of neuro dysfunction before 治療 are best predictors of neurologic outcome

• Urgent **whole-spine MRI** (Se 93%, Sp 97%); CT if unable to get MRI

治療 (_NEJM_ 2017;376:1358)

• **Dexamethasone** (10 mg IV × 1 stat, then 4 mg IV or PO q6h)

_initiate immediately_ while awaiting imaging if back pain + neurologic deficits

• Emergent RT or surgical decompression if confirmed compression/neuro deficits

• Surgery + RT superior to RT alone for neuro recovery in solid tumors (_Lancet_ 2005;366:643)

• If pathologic fracture causing compression → surgery; if not surgical candidate → RT

TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME

臨床表現 (_NEJM_ 2011;364:1844)

• Large tumor burden or a rapidly proliferating tumor → spontaneous or chemotherapy-induced release of intracellular electrolytes and nucleic acids

• Most common with 治療 of high-grade lymphomas (**Burkitt’s**) and leukemias (**ALL**, **AML**, **CML in blast crisis**); rare with solid tumors; rarely due to spontaneous necrosis

• Electrolyte abnormalities: ↑ K, ↑ uric acid, ↑ PO4 → ↓ Ca; **renal failure** (urate nephropathy)

Prophylaxis

• Allopurinol 300 mg qd to bid PO or 200–400 mg/m2 IV (adjusted for renal fxn) & aggressive hydration prior to beginning chemotherapy or RT

• Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) 0.15 mg/kg or 6-mg fixed dose (except in obese 病人) & aggressive hydration prior to beginning chemotherapy or RT (see below)

治療

• _Avoid_ IV contrast and NSAIDs; treat hyperK, hyperphos, and symptomatic hypocalcemia

• Allopurinol + aggressive IV hydration ± diuretics to ↑ UOP for goal 80–100 cc/h

• Consider alkalinization of urine with isotonic NaHCO3 to ↑ UA solubility, ↓ urate nephropathy risk (controversial: avoid with rasburicase; may cause met. alkalosis or Ca3(PO4)2 precip.)

• Rasburicase (0.1–0.2 mg/kg) for ↑↑ uric acid esp. in aggressive malig (_JCO_ 2003;21:4402; _Acta Haematol_ 2006;115:35). **_Avoid in G6PD deficiency_** b/c causes hemolytic anemia. Consider G6PD testing in Jehovah’s witnesses espec. if African American (12% prevalence).

• Hemodialysis may be necessary; early renal consultation for renal insufficiency or ARF
