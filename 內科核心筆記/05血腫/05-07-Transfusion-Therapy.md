# TRANSFUSION THERAPY

Transfusion reactions

• For all reactions (except minor allergic): **stop transfusion;** send remaining blood product and fresh blood sample to blood bank

• **Acute hemolytic:** fever, HoTN, flank pain, AKI within 24 h. Due to ABO incompatibility → preformed Abs vs. donor RBCs. Rx: IVF, ↑ UOP with diuretics, mannitol, or dopamine.

• **Delayed hemolytic:** generally less severe than acute hemolytic; 5–7 d after transfusion

Due to undetected allo-Abs against minor antigens → anamnestic response.

Rx: usually no specific therapy required; dx is important for future transfusion

• **Febrile nonhemolytic:** fever, rigors 0–6 h post transfusion. Due to Abs vs donor WBCs and cytokines in blood product. Rx: acetaminophen ± meperidine; 排除 infection, hemolysis.

• **Allergic:** urticaria; rarely, **anaphylaxis:** bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, hypotension

Reaction to transfused proteins; anaphylaxis seen in IgA-deficient 病人 with anti-IgA Abs.

Rx: urticaria → diphenhydramine; anaphylaxis → epinephrine ± glucocorticoids

• **Transfusion-associated circulatory overload** (TACO): ↑ volume → pulm edema, ↑ BP. Rx: slow transfusion rate, diuretics, O2, ± nitrates, ± positive pressure ventilation

• **Transfusion-related acute lung injury** (TRALI): noncardiogenic pulmonary edema Due to donor allo-Abs that bind recipient WBCs, which then aggregate in pulmonary vasculature and release mediators causing ↑ capillary permeability. Rx: see “ARDS.”
