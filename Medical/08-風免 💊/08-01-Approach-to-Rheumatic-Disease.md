# Approach to patient with joint pain
* **Articular** vs. **periarticular** (bursitis, tendinitis) source of pain: typically active ROM more painful than passive ROM in periarticular process
* **Inflammatory** vs. **noninflammatory** pain: _features of inflammatory pain_ include swelling, warmth or redness in specific joint, prolonged morning stiffness (>30 min), improvement of pain/stiffness w/ motion/exercise. Assess for extra-articular features.
* Physical exam: localize complaint, identify objective signs of inflammation, and assess number and pattern of affected joints
* The physical exam is only _50–70% sensitive_ for detecting inflammatory arthritis

Radiologic features of major arthritides

• **OA:** plain films: asym joint space narrowing (JSN), **osteophytes**, subchondral sclerosis & cysts; subchondral “gull-wing” erosions may be seen in less-common erosive OA; MRI may show early disease not seen on plain films; U/S ≈ MRI for structural damage ⊖

• **RA:** plain films: symmetric JSN, early = periarticular **osteopenia;** late = marginal **erosions**; subluxations; MRI & U/S can detect early and subclinical disease; MRI ≈ U/S for erosions

• **Gout:** plain films: early = nonspec swelling; late = **tophus**, joint erosions w/ overhanging edges; U/S for detection of microtophi (double-contour sign); dual-energy CT (DECT): identify articular/periarticular UrA deposits vs. calcium deposits; MRI ≈ U/S for erosions

• **Spondyloarthritis:** e/o **sacroiliitis**: plain films: early = pseudo-widening SI joint space, late = sclerosis, erosions, **ankylosis;** SI MRI ↑ Se for early Δ; U/S ≈ MRI to detect enthesitis
