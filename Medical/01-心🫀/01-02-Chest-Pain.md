# Initial approach

* *Focused history:* quality, severity, location, radiation; provoking/palliating factors; intensity at onset; duration, freq, & pattern; setting; assoc sx; cardiac hx & risk factors

* *Targeted exam:* VS (incl. BP in both arms); gallops, murmurs, rubs; signs of vascular dis. (carotid/femoral bruits, ↓ pulses) or CHF; lung & abd. exam; chest wall for reproducibility

* *12-lead ECG:*  obtain w/in 10 min; comp to priors & obtain serial ECGs; consider _posterior leads_ (V7–V9) to ✔ for posterior STEMI if: hx c/w ACS but stnd ECG unrevealing; ST ↓ V1–V3 (ant ischemia vs. post STEMI) w/ refractory angina; or R/S >1 in V1–V2

* **CXR;** other imaging (echo, PE CTA, etc.) as indicated based on H&P and initial testing

* **Troponin:** >_99th %ile w/ rise and/or fall in approp. setting is dx of AMI_ (_Circ_ 2018;138:e618)
	* Detectable 1–6 h after injury, 
	* peaks 24 h, may be elevated for 7–14 d in STEMI 
	* ✔ at presentation & 3–6 h later; repeat if clinical or ECG ∆s; 
	* ? sex-specific cutpoints If high-sens Tn (hsTn) assay, 
	* can ✔ at presentation & 1 h later; assess level & Δ

•Causes for ↑ Tn other than plaque rupture (= “type 1 MI”): (1) Supply-demand mismatch not due to ∆ in CAD (= “type 2 MI”; eg, ↑↑ HR, shock, HTN crisis, spasm, severe AS), (2) non-ischemic injury (myocarditis/toxic CMP, cardioversion, cardiac contusion) or (3) multifactorial (PE, sepsis, severe HF, renal failure, Takotsubo, infilt dis.)

•CK-MB: less Se & Sp than Tn (other sources: skel. muscle, intestine, etc.); CK-MB/CK ratio >2.5 → cardiac source. Limited utility: ? higher bar for post-revasc MI; early reMI.

**Early noninvasive imaging**

•Low prob of ACS (eg, ⊖ ECG & Tn) & stable → outPt or inPt noninv. fxnal or imaging test (qv)

•CCTA w/ high NPV, low PPV. ↓ LOS c/w fxnal testing (_NEJM_ 2012;366:1393). In stable outPt w/ CP, CCTA added to standard of care ↑ early but not overall angiography/revasc; ↑ use of preventive med Rx, and ↓ coronary death/MI at 5 y (_NEJM_ 2018;379:924).

•“Triple r/o” CT angiogram sometimes performed to r/o CAD, PE, AoD if dx unclear
